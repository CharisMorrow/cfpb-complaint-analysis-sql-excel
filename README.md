# Consumer Complaint Data Analysis – MySQL & Excel Project

This portfolio project demonstrates how the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/) complaint dataset can be analyzed using both **MySQL** and **Excel**. It showcases data modeling, cleaning, querying, and dashboarding skills to extract and present insights about complaint resolution trends across companies and products.

This project includes structured MySQL code for database setup, CSV data loading, and SQL queries to analyze metrics such as **average resolution time**, **monetary relief percentages**, and **unresolved complaint rates**. The Excel dashboard visualizes complaint trends by **year** and **product** using PivotTables and PivotCharts, each with built-in **company level filtering**. The dashboard also includes **two slicers** to enhance interactivity.
