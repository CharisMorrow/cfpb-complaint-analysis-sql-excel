JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,Credit card,4/28/2024,TX,"Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to submit a formal complaint against my credit card company for incorrectly handling a dispute regarding hotel charges. Below is a summary of the events leading to the dispute and the issue with the credit card companys response : XXXX. Initial Hotel Booking Issue : I was incorrectly charged for an additional night by a hotel. Despite my attempts to resolve the issue directly with the hotel, they refused to refund the extra charge. 
XXXX. Dispute Filed : On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a dispute with my credit card company regarding the additional nights charge, which was made without my consent. 
XXXX. Dispute Denied : The credit card company denied my dispute within hours of making the dispute, citing a cancellation policy and stating there was no record of me canceling. This is confusing and irrelevant to my claim, as my dispute concerns being charged for a night I did not authorize, not a cancellation. 
XXXX. Lack of Proper Investigation : The denial suggests that the credit card company did not adequately investigate the circumstances surrounding the hotels incorrect charge. There was no need for a cancellation, as my issue was with being incorrectly charged for an extra night I did not book. 

This incorrect handling of my dispute has not only left me unfairly out of pocket but also questions the efficacy of the dispute resolution process provided by my credit card company. I seek the CFPBs assistance to investigate this matter and to ensure that a fair and just resolution is reached. 

Thank you for your attention to this issue.",Closed with explanation,4/28/2024

CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,Credit card,4/13/2024,PA,"I recently filed a complaint about this credit card company and their fraud team. They had placed a fraud hold on my account and refused to lift it until I made a XXXX way call with them on the line with my bank. Capital One kept saying they needed to confirm with my bank on the line that it was me making the payment. I filed a complaint with CFPB. I did not feel comfortable having a complete stranger on the line while I gave my bank all of my personal data to get access to my bank account. After they responded to the complaint, I spoke to a gentleman in the fraud department. He took the restriction off my credit card and put a request to open my Quicksilver card. The restriction on the card was lifted but another restriction is on the account now and Capital One keeps saying that the card is closed. It has been escalated to a supervisor XXXX or XXXX times already. 

I opened a CD with Capital One and I also opened a new Venture card. On XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment off {$1000.00} on my Venture card. My balance reflected the payment but not my available credit. I called Capital One and spoke to XXXX, a Senior Supervisor ID XXXX. I told her I was not a new customer to Capital One. I have had credit cards with this bank for several years. I have used the same checking account to make payments before, I have a CD and a high yield savings account with this bank as well. She told me it didn't matter what I had with Capital One that since this was a new card it was treated as a new account and it didn't matter how long I was with Capital One or what products I had. 

They had placed a 7 day hold on my available credit even though they already had the payment. I switched all of my automatic payments to this card and transactions were being denied because of the available credit. XXXX forced me to make a XXXX way call with my bank where she got to hear my account balance and full debit card number. I told her this was how fraud happens. She justified it with "" We are your bank ''. So I guess because it's my bank I can give all of my personal information to them at their leisure? After the phone call with my bank XXXX reads disclosures she was supposed to have read before listening to all of my personal data with my checking account. 

The payment was verified and the hold was lifted. I made a second payment of {$1000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. The same thing happened. I called Capital One XX/XX/XXXX and was transferred to fraud. I spoke to XXXX ID XXXX. Nobody can tell me why there is another hold on my payment. They won't release the funds unless I make another call with my bank so a complete stranger can listen to how to get access to my checking account. 

I want to know what is up with this bank? Are these practices legal? Does Capital One want to alienate its customers? 

I thought this whole ordeal was resolved with my first complaint and that's why I had opened a CD and a high yield savings account. Had I known nobody fixed anything, I would not have done that. Now I am stuck with a Venture card that I can't use because they keep placing fraud hold on it and my Quicksilver card is still closed and restricted.",Closed with explanation,4/13/2024

AmEx would then pay me a {$750.00} bonus as a credit to the account. 

I fulfilled the terms of the offer clear as a bell. The account opened in XX/XX/XXXX and by the XX/XX/XXXX statement, I had charged much more than the {$15000.00} offer requirement. So I should have received the {$750.00} bonus at that time or soon thereafter. 

When I did not receive the bonus, I contacted AmEx on XX/XX/XXXX and it claimed it had no record of the bonus offer. The service rep started a "" case '' ( reference # XXXX ) to investigate my complaint, but I never heard any reply from AmEx. 

Today, I contacted AmEx again, and it now says that "" no offer is attached to my account '', but the rep said she would start a new complaint "" case ''. 

I have XXXX trust in AmEx at this time and would like the CFPB to investigate/inquire about this on my behalf. I knew about the offer due to AmEx 's promotional mailing, and I fulfilled the terms it specified. I now rely on the CFPB to shame AmEx into living up to its obligations.

Mr. Cooper Group Inc.,Mortgage,6/3/2024,WA,"Our loan loan was being serviced by XXXX originally which they reported it late on our credit during a COVID forbearance. We had to file a complaint back a few months ago to remove the late payments which has been fixed. 

The loan was transferred to Mr. Cooper during the forbearance. It took months to get Mr. Cooper to finalize the forbearance but when it was finalized they claim to have sent mail regarding the terms. They told us to call which we did several times to confirm the final details of the forbearance ending but they continued to tell us we had to wait because it was also too new in their system. 

We logged in yesterday to see the account and it showed it was 30 days past due. We called and they claim the forbearance was finalized as a COVID forbearance and the first payment after the forbearance would be XX/XX/XXXX but we weren't notified. They claimed to have mailed us but we haven't seen the mail and for the first few months they took the loan over they promised our credit would be protected due to the COVID forbearance and the recent servicing transfer but now they're saying the two protections ended and they're going to report late. 

We don't understand why we're under short timelines to finalize a combined COVID forbearance and servicing transfer. We made the payments to get the mortgage caught up but we believe the servicer, who couldn't give any answers for the first 60 days we were notified of the transfer should be giving us grace on the reporting. We proactively contacted them several times hoping they would have clear answers and they didn't. Instead, they promised we would be protected, never called back and claim we were notified with mail only which we didn't receive. They are also claiming the credit protections for the servicing transfer and the COVID forbearance both ended the same time so they started the same time, ended the same time but since the loan was transferred in the middle of the forbearance they didn't extend the protection perpetually. They both ended the same time but the complexity of the situation didn't allow them to give us an answer at the time of the transfer. In short, the protections didn't do what they're supposed to do and the complexity of a loan transfer in the middle of the COVID forbearance prohibited the new servicer from handling the transfer and the end of the forbearance properly resulting in our negative reporting.

II received a popup at the ATM saying my account was unavailable Friday, XX/XX/2024 XXXX EST I called Synchrony Bank to ask why I couldnt access my account and I needed access to withdraw money immediately. 

The person I spoke with said I needed to submit an address verification document. He did not specify what was proper verification. I submitted the 1st page of my bank statement from another bank with my account number removed. My address and name and name of the bank were clear. He told me it would take a few hours for them to process the document. I emailed my address verification document to the mail provided to me by the rep, XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX  EST I called Synchrony Bank back and informed them I emailed my address verification to XXXX and they can proceed to process it so I can access my funds. 

The person I spoke to said it will take 2-3 days to process. I told them they needed to escalate it because I needed money immediately. She repeated that they can only unlock the account after the verification has been reviewed and accepted for my new mailing address. 

I told her that doesn't make any sense because I changed my mailing address months prior and NEVER received any email stating that a verification letter needs to be submitted with my change of address. Also, I was making deposits and withdraws from the account for MONTHS even this month, XXXX. 

I was NEVER informed an address verification was required. I received no emails from Synchrony Bank that this was needed. The only emails I received from them were when a transaction was made to any of my accounts. 

I asked why was this block put on my account so quickly without sending me an email about the issue. She just repeated the same thing It will take 2-3 days to process the address verification letter, and they can only unlock the account after the verification has been reviewed and accepted for the new mailing address.

I told her it was absolutely urgent because I only had {$9.00} and needed access to my money immediately. She just repeated, it will take 2-3 days to process the address verification letter, and they can only unlock the account after the verification has been reviewed and accepted for the new mailing address.

I asked to have it escalated to a manager they repeated the same thing the woman said. I was absolutely FURIOUS they were not moving on my issue or trying to find a solution. 
That manager hung up the phone on me because he didnt like my language. 

XXXX XXXX EST I called back after being hung up on after Synchrony Bank refused to give me access to my money. The person I spoke to repeated, it will take 2-3 days to process the address verification letter, and they can only unlock the account after the verification has been reviewed and accepted for the new mailing address and said absolutely nothing else.

I asked how do I close my 4 accounts with Synchrony. She said, after they process the address verification letter, then you can close your accounts I just hung up the phone I was furious and frustrated. They were not going to do anything extra to help me This was the worst banking experience Ive ever had in my life. I have {$9.00} in my accessible account and they expected me to wait for 2-3 days with NO MONEY. Horrible experience especially since the issue was from their end.

SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,Credit card,4/17/2024,VA,"I'm extremely frustrated because Synchrony 's practices constitute an unfair or deceptive act or practice to consumers ( myself and similarly situated ). 

I opened a Synchrony Home Design credit card for a purchase related to our new home in XXXX, XXXX. That account was paid in full in XXXX, XXXX  - well before the end of the XXXX month promotional period. The promotion offered was deferred interest ( 0  % ) during the XXXX month promotional period. Imagine my surprise when I received a bill for {$5.00} at the beginning of XXXX. Since I was on 0 % and paid off within the promotional period, I went to look at my recent transactions and found that Synchrony had been charging a minimum interest charge of {$2.00} plus "" interest charge on purchases '' since about XXXX of XXXX. ( I was unable to pull transactions prior to XXXX, and my statements won't download off their mobile app either. ) Although the {$2.00} minimum interest charge is disclosed when you go and look up the Consumer Credit Card Agreement on the CFPB webpage, it is not something a consumer on a 0 % deferred interest plan is likely to ask about when completing an application for credit by phone after being told the first XXXX months are at 0 %. 

Not only that, but it turns out that the interest charges are being assessed on fees - fees that are already high ( up to {$41.00} ). So for the month of XXXX, even though the account was paid in full, I was charged a total of {$5.00} in interest between the minimum interest charge and the interest being charged on fees. We had no intention of paying this account off beyond XXXX months, so I don't recall whether the "" go to '' rate was disclosed in the application process. 

In addition, which would/should ordinarily be helpful, any late fee is included in the minimum periodic payment due, which an ordinary consumer would believe would take care of the fee so that interest would not be charged. Apparently, that is not the case and interest is being charged anyway. When I asked about the application of grace to the account, the answer provided by the representative didn't actually answer the question. It's almost like Synchrony is applying interest immediately ( like a Cash Advance ) since there is an outstanding promotional balance on the account. Is that what's happening? My question wasn't answered. 

So in a nutshell, the practice of opening accounts by phone without proper disclosure, including disclosing that apparently Synchrony treats fees the same as a "" purchase '' ( which is not intuitive ) on an account that's being SOLD as a 0 % promotional account that is paid off within the promotional period and nonetheless winding up with surprise interest after the account is presumably paid in full is something the CFPB should look into as a UDAP. I strongly suggest looking at the sales practices for account opening and whether disclosure requirements related to timing and format are adhered to because, in my experience, they were not. I can afford the interest charges to my account, but I'm angry for other consumers that may not be able to afford those charges. Charging minimum interest charges on minute balances is unfair. Not allowing a customer to make a payment for more than the minimum due to prevent trailing interest is unfair. The practices in this instance were unfair - my account should be closed with a {$0.00} balance and I shouldn't have to be dealing with trailing interest. 

On top of all this, the system won't allow you to submit a payment for more than the account balance, even though there is trailing interest accruing on an account that's already accruing interest. So, I couldn't make an additional {$2.00} payment to avoid the minimum interest charge likely to hit me next cycle. That is beyond frustrating as well. It's like there is no end to this process. I'd rather pay an extra {$2.00} so the balance is really {$0.00}. Just watch me still be trying to chase down this minimum interest charge and wind up getting hit with all of the deferred interest due to unfair business practices. I'm beyond frustrated. My account should not be past due and accruing interest right now. Unbelievable. 

In summary : 1 ) Look at Synchrony 's sales practices. There is something wrong. 
2 ) Look at Synchrony 's interest charge practices. Late fees are not purchases. A {$2.00} minimum interest charge on a {$3.00} INTEREST balance is unfair. 
3 ) Look at Synchrony 's payment practices. Preventing a consumer from making a payment {$2.00} higher than the current {$5.00} to prevent trailing interest is unfair.",Closed with explanation,4/17/2024

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,Checking or savings account,4/14/2024,CA,"I am writing to express my profound concern and dissatisfaction with JPMorgan Chases recent policy changes regarding the checking account fees, which I believe disproportionately impact economically disadvantaged customers. This policy not only undermines financial inclusivity but also exacerbates the economic challenges faced by the lower-income demographics.

It has come to my attention that Chase has decided to double the fees associated with maintaining a basic checking account. This decision is particularly disheartening and appears to be profoundly unjust, as it targets those least able to afford such increases. While any fee hike is a burden, doubling them in a single policy update is both severe and unreasonable. It is essential to recognize that for many individuals, a checking account is not a luxury but a necessity for managing their personal finances, receiving income, and paying bills. 

Furthermore, it is troubling to perceive that the additional revenue generated from these increased fees on basic checking accounts is contributing to a cycle of wealth accumulation at the very top, enabling a lifestyle of extreme luxury, such as yacht ownership, for the wealthiest individuals. This stark contrast in lifestyle opportunities, seemingly funded by those at the bottom of the economic ladder, is morally unsettling and paints a picture of a banking system that favors the rich at the expense of the poor. It prompts the frustrated outcry among many : "" eat the rich. '' In light of these points, I urge Chase to reconsider this approach and seek ways to structure its fee strategies in a manner that does not disproportionately impact its most vulnerable customers. Adopting a more progressive fee structure or providing more robust waivers for low-income individuals could be potential solutions. It is crucial for Chase to align its business practices with principles of fairness and social responsibility, particularly in these challenging economic times.

Thank you for considering this critical issue. I look forward to your response and to seeing how Chase plans to address these concerns moving forward.",Closed with explanation,4/14/2024

Failure to Obtain Consent : JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. allegedly reported information without the written consent of the consumer, as required by FCRA Section 604.

Misrepresentation of Credit Payments : They argue that JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. misrepresented credit payments, potentially committing security fraud.

Legal Action Threat : They threaten legal action if JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. fails to comply with their demands and request the transfer of funds to their Treasury Direct Account within three days.

The terms of the offer included making a specified amount of spending to receive an upgrade bonus of approximately XXXX XXXX points.

I have since closed that particular card and currently hold another American Express XXXX XXXX XXXX card. However, the issue of the missing XXXX points from the previous card remains unresolved. 

Given the circumstances, I kindly request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to assist me in this matter.

Mr. Cooper Group Inc.,Mortgage,8/19/2022,MD,"This is not a matter that I need personally resolved. I am fine. I have not fallen for what I view as the predatory behavior of Nationstar DBA Mr. Cooper. Rather, I simply would like to draw this to the attention of the CFPB because in my opinion its despicable, wrongful, predatory, misleading, and for all I know perhaps it is illegal. 

A few months ago the servicer and owner of my VA Mortgage ( XXXX ) transferred ownership of the mortgage servicing rights to Nationstar DBA Mr. Cooper. Previously, they had been the sub servicer. 

Since then, the new loan servicer ( Mr. Cooper ) has been trying to get me to refinance my loan by sending me monthly solicitations. In my view, they are not doing so in good faith. For example, today I again received a flyer in the mail from Mr. Cooper which says : Now that youre a Mr. Cooper customer, well be keeping an eye out for ways to make your loan even better. 

Keep in mind that I am only their customer involuntarily. In any event how does Mr. Cooper propose to make my loan even better? By replacing it. Yes, according to these guys, my loan will even better if I engage in a cash out refinance. So my loan ( 30 year VA fixed at 3 % ) would be replaced by their loan on terms XXXX  but certainly not at 3 percent. 

If they want to send advertising to their captive customers I suppose thats their privilege, but it should not be ok to do so in a manner apparently intended to entice potentially gullible customers with what ( in my opinion ) are lies. If my loan is to be replaced, as they propose, it could not be even better because it would no longer exist. Further, putting that silly rhetoric aside, it is simply false by any reasonable standard to suggest that the loan they are proposing is even better than the one I have. 

As I said above, this is not a personal problem for me. I am not fooled by this. I have no interest in refinancing and would never voluntarily enter into a new relationship with Mr. Cooper. I simply want to suggest that the CFPB might want to look into this kind of advertising by this company. It really is unconscionable.",Closed with explanation,8/19/2022

After requesting to input their XXXX information into my phone, they accessed my device and initiated an unauthorized XXXX Friends and Family transaction for {$2500.00}, funded by my American Express credit card. 

Upon discovering the fraudulent transaction almost immediately, I contacted American Express through their online support and requested them to cancel the pending transaction. The Amex representative assured me that they would monitor the transaction and handle it, and stated that I did not need to contact XXXX myself. Based on this assurance, I did not take further immediate action such as filing a police report. 

Despite my prompt reporting, the pending transaction was allowed to post to my account. Later, Amex rebilled me for the full amount after initially crediting it back, stating that XXXX categorized the payment as peer-to-peer and thus outside their fraud protections. 

I was extremely disappointed that Amex : Failed to stop a fraudulent pending transaction despite immediate notice, Relied solely on XXXX categorization without properly investigating the nature of the fraud, Did not allow me an opportunity to provide full evidence before making their final decision, Did not provide a clear or satisfactory explanation as to why this obvious scam was not treated as fraud under their policies.

I immediately called, the same day, to find out how to retrieve my funds. I sent an email to XXXX as instructed. After six weeks with no response, I called back and filed a complaint and was told someone would get back to me in two weeks. And I sent another email to unclaimedproperty. After another four weeks and no contact, I called again and attempted to escalate to another level. These new people were no help whatsoever and were at a loss where to send me next. I called the unclaimed property number and was told to go a branch and they would have the information on claiming property. The branch has absolutely no way of knowing what to do and cancelled my appointment after eight days, because eight days was their first available appointment. I called the unclaimed property back tonight, XXXX XX/XX/2022 immediately after my appointment was cancelled, and was told they should never have sent me to a branch. All I could do was file another complaint, my fourth. 
So how do I claim unclaimed property : 1. There is no information on claiming unclaimed property anywhere on the Wells Fargo website.

2. There is no information on claiming unclaimed property from any of the Wells Fargo customer service phone numbers.

3. There is no information on claiming unclaimed property from unclaimed property phone line.

4. No one at the Wells Fargo branch has any idea how to claim unclaimed property.

After 12 weeks of trying, and filing four complaints that were supposed to result in being contacted, I still have not a single idea of how to submit a claim. I don't know what documents they might want, or forms to fill out.

I have been told repeatedly by Wells Fargo that the case numbers I refer to have no meaning or use whatsoever. So every phone call results in a new file being opened, with all the same information regurgitated by me, followed by the promise of being contacted in two weeks. I have spent 17 hours on the phone with Wells Fargo and have not ever received a single piece of information in regard to claiming unclaimed property. I have made zero forward progress and have no hope of any, as I have now called every recommended number, and keep getting referred back to the same numbers that have already resulted in nothing.",Closed with explanation,10/13/2022

CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,Credit card,3/18/2024,NM,"I had a SPARK business credit card with Capital One, I have been using it actively and was paid automatically with no delay, then, my credit card stopped working and I thought I ran the magnetic stripe. Never thought anything of it as my bills were always paid and I froze my credit account last year in avoidance of hacking or identity theft. 
Then, I called on XX/XX/XXXX and I was told that my account was closed by the bank because they sent me mail requesting my business XXXX number, and address and my failure to respond caused my credit card to be closed. After hearing this from the representative I immediately, paid off my remaining balance right there and then because that is who I am I pay my debts. Then, when I asked about my points, I was told that it was already redeemed when I have not redeemed a single point. During that call, on XX/XX/XXXX, the representative said that to call back because it's on redemption. 
My reason of complains are the following : 1. Capital One did not ensure that I will receive the postal mail that was supposedly mailed last XX/XX/XXXX. It was not a registered mail, there was no follow up mail or letter to assure that's its been received. 
2. I never received any text or courtesy call regarding this matter.

3. I never heard back from Capital one at all.

4. I only realized that the problem was not the physical credit card when my automatic bill pay was cancelled. I could have lost my benefits from my insurance company because of this action from Capital One. 
I deserve to be treated kindly and with respect and fairness. 

This is an unacceptable action from Capital One. I want my points back, I paid for it and own it. This company needs to change their procedure in contacting clients, it is wrong and ineffective to assume that a single non registered letter is sufficient to get the attention of their clients when we now live in the digital age.

XXXX that had to be paid on or before XX/XX/2025 - On XX/XX/2025 I logged in to my online U.S. Bank account and found that U.S. Bank had completely removed my credit card account from online access, meaning I could NOT make the needed payment on my settlement agreement to be in compliance, so I called U.S. bank on XXXX XXXX and spoke with a supervisor at length and all she could tell me was U.S. Bank had already charged off my credit card account and that is why it was removed from my online access, However as I pointed out U.S. Bank was in a settlement agreement THEY OFFERED me and said settlement agreement did not end until XX/XX/2025 so 1. How could they charge off my credit card account before the agreed settlement deadline date? 2. Why was my credit card account removed from my online account access so I could make the needed and agreed upon payments on my account? - Seems to me that U.S. Bank made a settlement agreement with a customer, then forced the customer to make a large payment at the time of settlement acceptance and then took adverse actions against said customer so they defaulted on the settlement agreement, meaning U.S. Bank made more of a profit and then still go after the customer for the full balance owed- which is shady, unprofessional at best and breach of contract given they made an agreement in writing that I had until XX/XX/2025 to pay the remaining balance owed on the settlement and then before that date took adverse actions against me by 1. charging off my credit card account BEFORE the expiration of the settlement agreement. 2. By removing my online account access so I was not able to make the payments needed on my account- Now just today I received a collection letter from XXXX XXXX, XXXX stating they are a debt collector for U.S. Bank for the amount of {$3000.00} - what U.S. Bank has done is morally, ethically wrong and might even board line be illegal and they should be held accountable for their actions",Closed with explanation,5/6/2025

Within an hour of my last transaction the aforementioned charges took place, and I was not made aware of the custodianship or potential fraud/breach of security that had taken place on my account. 

After speaking with representatives from Fraud claim specialists to bankers, and even in-person visits, all agreed that these transactions were worth evaluating further. My claim was submitted and has since been denied, without any information about who committed the crime and I would like to continue with a police investigation. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I spent XXXX $ on the XXXX, heading to the post office to purchase my passport where I spent XXXX $ where I was recorded and sworn under oath.

I do not know anyone named XXXX XXXX and I did not verify a custodian on my account. These purchases were not made or authorized by me. She then told me that she would remove the custodian from the account and close down my debit card and credit card accounts, as well as send me new cards. 

Immediately after that call, I received another call from a banker who informed me that the process had not been completed and that I needed to file claims and close down my accounts. He then forwarded me to a claims representative who also informed me that suspicious activity had taken place on my account and that I needed to file an XXXX Fraud Claim # XXXX. Once there I shut down my checking account and created an entirely new online profile/password. I was then told I could receive a temporary card from my local Branch until my new one had been mailed to me. 

The next day XX/XX/XXXX I went to visit my local Branch who then informed me that I had to use a mobile wallet because temporary cards were no longer a service they provided. I was then told by the branch manager who walked me to the atm that there was trouble with accessing my mobile wallet and that I could only make withdrawals from inside the branch. I then sat down with a banker who then helped me access my mobile Wallet after talking with other representatives on the phone. He then informed me that because there was Fraud my new card had been placed on hold, and that I now had access to it.

He then connected me to an ATM claims specialist because he noticed a claim had not been made even though transactions were disputed. Once I spoke with the claims officer he gave me Reference # XXXX and told me that a claim would be submitted.

I then asked to speak to a Supervisor who spoke to me with hostility and outright expressed that he agreed with the terms of my denied claim being that travel alerts had been made, that correlated with the initial transactions. 

Being that my account was allowed a custodian without my verification or notification I am led to believe that Fraud has been committed on my account.

"Bread Financial Holdings, Inc.",Credit card,5/2/2024,FL,"This is regarding a backdated interest charge from Comenity Financial/Bread Financial , which manages customer credit accounts for XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a purchase online from XXXX XXXX XXXX totaling {$2100.00}. The promotion for this purchase was 18-month interest-free financing. The expiration date for this was XX/XX/XXXX. 

My due dates each billing cycle are on the 2nd. This falls 3 days AFTER the balance subject to interest was due. On XX/XX/XXXX, I mistakenly made my standard payment rather than the balance in full. 

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I was charged {$950.00} in backdated interest that would have begun accruing from the date of the original purchase. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, when I had realized my error ( because of credit notification services I've signed up for ), I called Comenity and asked that they please remove the charge and in exchange, I would pay the entire remainder of the balance. They refused to work with me and claimed that they did not have the ability to do this ( which I know is not true ). I requested to speak with a supervisor and was told the same thing. Furthermore, they told me if I had called within 3 days, they could have removed the charge, but now that it's a week and a half later, they can not work with me. I called two additional times to try and correct the matter and I had no luck. 

Their method for reminding customers that a promotion is expiring is intentionally non-transparent. The XXXX statements have a notice with the date of expiration, but nothing else. Most other companies make it clear within the online account that there is an upcoming expiration, and they additionally send emails to make clear reminders to the customer. Many other companies no longer charge backdated interest when they offer a promotional interest period. They simply begin collecting interest on the remaining balance. 

This is highly predatory and is unreasonable, per the CFPB 's reasonable consumer standards. 

While I am aware that I would have entered into an agreement with the credit card company by nature of applying for the card and making a purchase, I do not believe that actions taken by Comenity are acceptable or fair for consumers, and their lack of cooperation has placed undue financial pressure on my family. 

Furthermore, I do want to make it known that Comenity has a strict late fee policy coupled with a time-sensitive payment deadline that is by far NOT industry standard.

U.S. BANCORP,Checking or savings account,3/20/2022,AZ,"US Bank Stole {$6200.00} from my business account. 

On XX/XX/2022 US Bank deducted {$6200.00} from my business account without any prior notice by phone, email, or letter. I called US Bank customer service on XX/XX/2022 and was advised that the {$6200.00} was a reversal of a previous credit issued on my debit card. After several more phone calls I was advised to submit documentation regarding the claim filed which I did through the local branch on XX/XX/2022. 

On XX/XX/2022 I was advised by customer service representative XXXX that the case had been resolved and that the {$6200.00} would be back in my account within 24-48 hours. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called once again and was advised that the information I had been given by XXXX on XX/XX/2022 was not accurate and that my case had still not been looked at but it had been escalated to a supervisor named XXXX. I asked for XXXX information and phone number and was told that nobody has access to the dispute personnel not even branch managers and that I would be contacted within 24-48 hours if more information was neccessary. 

On XX/XX/2022 I received a phone call from dispute supervisor "" XXXX ''. XXXX said because the documents were not sent in within US Bank guidelines the {$6200.00} would not be returned back into my account. I asked if the money was being returned to the merchant and XXXX advised that it was not and that US Bank would be keeping the money. XXXX was very beligerant and her attitude was very non-chalant. XXXX said there was nothing more she would do and if wasn't happy I should send a letter to XXXX XXXX the bank President in North Dakota. 

I asked XXXX to confirm the address that the document request was sent to and if the call was being recorded. She said in fact the call was being recorded and on the recorded line she read me back the address that DID NOT include my suite number which is why I never received the document request. I asked her also why it was ok for her to call me and tell me US Bank was keeping {$6200.00} but they could not give me a courtesy call to let me know that they needed additional documentation to support my case for {$6200.00}. In a very beligerant manner XXXX replied that supervisors never called out for information and it would be impossible to call given she had over 100 cases per day to look at. XXXX also went on to say that the document letters are auto-generated and the revocation is automatic if the deadline expires without receipt. 

This appears to be an effective strategy for US Bank to steal thousands of dollars from their account holders and a criminal investigation should be done by the FBI for wire fraud and bank fraud. 

I will be sending letters to the Attorney General in Arizona, North Dakota, and MN to advise them of my situation as well I will be copying my local Rep Congressman XXXX and XXXX XXXX.",Closed with explanation,3/20/2022
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,Credit card,8/12/2024,GA,"On my American Express app I was given an offer bonus of XXXX Amex points to sign up for the Amex Gold card. I used an online point calculator and saw that this was worth around $ XXXX {$2000.00} dollars depending on redemption methods. I deemed that the application was worth it considering the XXXX XXXX  yearly card fee. I noted this offer and decided I would apply. I did not have time to apply immediately, but decided I would when I had the opportunity. 

Several weeks later I applied. I did so by googling the offer. The offer I found was XXXX. I did not remember that the previous offer I had received was for XXXX points. I simply remembered that there was a bonus offer of many thousands of points that were worth approximately $ XXXX {$2000.00}. 

After some webpage errors in the application process I decided to call in to apply by phone. The agent walked me through the phone application process and verified my XXXX bonus offer. At no point did he make it known I had an available XXXX point offer instead. I applied for the card and it was approved. 

Less than an hour later I logged into my app again and saw there was still an offer for the gold card, but it showed XXXX points instead of the XXXX points I had just signed up for moments ago. I called Amex phone support but then said the correct department was closed. I called the next day ( today ) and told them the situation. Both agents I worked with said it was impossible to change the offer. 

I do not believe it is impossible to change the offer. I made an honest, human mistake that I believe would be fair to have Amex correct, especially because the agent during the application process had the ability to correct me but did not. I am excited to have this card, but this first step has left a rather unpleasant taste that I believe is unnecessary and unfair. 

As of writing this complaint, the XXXX offer is still available on my account, and says it will remain available until XX/XX/year>. 

As I do not currently have my new accounts card number, I have placed the last 5 digits of another credit card I have with Amex to assist in locating my account for this complaint.",Closed with non-monetary relief,8/12/2024

Clearly they were fishing to see how much was in the account. 

I then realized on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX I received a notice from Chase that I had insufficient funds for 2 checks for my checking account and was charged for that. Since I did not write any recent or large checks I reviewed my checking and saw 2 checks for the amount of {$4800.00} written to a XXXX XXXX, which I did not write.

Back in XX/XX/XXXX, I was driving to my home town of XXXX XXXX, CA when I received an text alert for suspicious activity and that my debit card charged an amount of {$170.00} for XXXX XXXX ( Screen shot attached ). This started all the fraud that Chase Fraud department has not been willing to help me with. 

I responded it was not me. I was send an automated message that my debt car was closed and a new one would be issues. 

While I was out of town for a family members baby shower, more fraudulent activities happened. Three charges for the same amount happened using the new card that was issues and automatically uploaded to a scammers XXXX XXXX account ( which I was not aware of ). Mind you I never had this card in hand because it hadnt even been shipped to me. 

While I was in XXXX XXXX, CA ; 500 miles away from XXXX XXXX, These are the three charges that happened in XXXX XXXX using a debit card that I had no access to. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - {$240.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - {$240.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - {$240.00} TOTAL = {$740.00} I was not using that account while out of town because thought I had not access to it. So when I checked my account and seen the three charges, I immediately called and reported Fraud on my account again, while still out of town. Your team proceeded to cancel the NEW card issued and sent another one while I was still out of town. It then happened again and I did the same thing. ( WOW ) When I returned to XXXX I called and talked to one of your Fraud specialists who had explained that the debt cards we never closed, just cancelled, so when YOU kept sending me new debt cards it would upload to my digital wallet that was more than likely compromised. He reassured me that everything looked suspicious and I should have no issues. 

Weeks later I am going to pay bills and my account is significantly lower on funds. I check as they that Chase fraud department had reversed the charges and took the money back. I was told CHASE agreed that the charges I disputed were suspicious but because they were made in the geographical region that I live, I was denied a refund. 

I was very upset and frustrated and was advised to Fax proof to Chase Fraud Department that I was out of town during the times fraud was happening on my account ending in XXXX and I would have a response within 5-7 business days. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I faxed The Chase Fraud Department a letter of my explanation along with two different account statements that are mine, one being another joint Chase account that I have with my wife and the other a XXXX gas credit card. I highlighted all the charges, transaction and gas purchases made while on my trip that all indicated they were made outside of the XXXX XXXX area. 

I called back XX/XX/XXXX because I had not heard anything back. When spoke to another person from the fraud department, she claimed I never sent supporting documents, but after further looking into the matter she said she found them and said it would take another 5-7 business day from that date. Meanwhile my bills have been backing up and not paid due to this loss in money. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called back to see if there was any result, I thought for sure Chase would help seeing that they had asked for documents showing I was out of town. After speaking to a representative they now said after further review they could not refund me because the fraud department showed that the purchased were made online, on a device using XXXX XXXX and because there was no change in the changes to the device during the time, they couldnt prove it wasnt me. 

I pleaded with them and said, One I dont even use XXXX XXXX and Two I wouldnt go through all these lengths, why would I spend {$240.00}, three different times at different places, my account has never shown activity like that. I also said I am a veteran and have been with Chase for a long time, I Im just seeking help to recover my money that was stolen. They basically told me that they couldnt help. 

So I then proceeded to ask if Chase can provide the XXXX name, email address and IP address of the device. I explained to them that I HAVE NEVER used XXXX XXXX  in my life and dont have it installed in any of my devices. I am not tech savvy but I figured they have access to see what was used, since it was the Chase Fraud department that told me the three charges being disputed were made from a XXXX XXXX account. 

I woke up today XX/XX/XXXX with a response from Chase : Dear Retail Claims Customer, We have received your request and reviewed your claim. Your claim is : Claim # : XXXX Claim Status : Closed Additional information : We have received your request and reviewed it. Unfortunately this is not something we are able to process. We apologize for the inconvenience. If you have any further questions please don't hesitate to reach out to us. Thank you for choosing Chase.

Id like to know how I can get help to recover the money that was stolen. {$740.00} for a XXXX veteran is a lot of money to be taken. I keep providing proof that the fraud department asks for and they keep changing the proof requirements. I even sent documents from XXXX showing that I my XXXX account has never had a XXXX XXXX  set up, I explained in my logical thinking that whoever scammed my debit card had it connected to their wallet and XXXX account, but chase wouldnt listen.

The conversation was difficult, and I elected to end the call and start over. I suspect this first representative placed a fraud alert on my account because when I called back, the second representative stated that he could not issue me a replacement card and I was transferred to a fraud detection department. I asked the fraud detection agent if it was normal practice for customers to have to speak to the fraud detection department to request a replacement card. I felt like I was being interrogated by the police for a credit card that I never received. The agent was not going to issue me a card unless I submitted to his interrogation. I was not reporting any unauthorized transactions and there was no activity on the account because I never received the physical card. I subsequently decided to close the account. I believe Wells Fargo routinely engages in discriminatory practices with certain groups of people.

On XX/XX/XXXX I deposited a check made out to my company which I did not endorse. Ive never endorsed them before and never had a problem until now. The deposit of this check resulted in my account being frozen and then closed without notice. I only found out because I went to deposit another check and they told me this was a closed account and it had been for days. I only knew my account had been frozen after I called on the XXXX of the same month to enquire why I wasnt able to make payments out of my account. It was then that they informed me that they had a hold on the check but it would cleared in a couple of days. This later turned out to be false because they closed the account after the hold was removed. When I called my client, who was the one who wrote me this check, they told me that the check cleared fine on their end. This was news to me because one of the times I called Chase they told me the problem was on my clients end with their bank. I also went to the branch three times to speak to the branch manager and he tried to help me by calling the deposit review department in Chase. He even requested to speak to a supervisor on that department which didnt help. The Chase branch manager told me that this was not their policy at the branch and pointed out the exact policy he was referring to to the representative on the phone because they were saying information that did not match up with the policy his branch followed.

Now, Chase refuses to release my money that was in the account, stating that more checks are under investigation because they need to speak to makers of each check even though they have already been cleared months ago. Another frustrating part of this is is the telephone verifying system that Chase uses. The phone number on the check has to match what they have in the system. They wont call the phone number that is on the check if it is not verified. I have reached out to multiple clients to get phone numbers from them, only to be told by Chase that those phone numbers are not in their system therefore they cant verify the client or their check.

On XX/XX/2024, I called customer service, they stated I placed a stop payment with my credit union, which I did not, but the {$30.00} late payment fee would be removed. I called my credit union and was told no request for payment was ever received from Synchrony Bank. The issue, as it was explained to me, is at their end, my banking information needs to be erased and manually entered by them. ( This apparently happens often ) I phoned customer service, spoke with XXXX, she erased my banking information, and I was told to re-enter it on the website, which I did. 
XX/XX/XXXX, I re-entered my banking information and made another {$200.00} payment. On XX/XX/2024, I was charged another {$30.00} for a returned payment. My payment was returned again! I received a voicemail on XX/XX/2024, from Synchrony Bank requesting a call back, this prompted me to check my account, that is how I found out the payment had been returned again. I immediately called customer service, but now I am flagged as being delinquent, so I am diverted to collections. I finally got transferred to customer service, spoke with XXXX, and they don't even want to try to fix the issue on their end. Seems they would rather continue piling on the {$30.00} fees ( which is more than my interest, they are really raking in the big bucks with me, {$60.00} per month! ) They are getting a late fee and a returned payment fee, and the issue is caused by them. Is this racketeering?

I want my late fees and return payment fees reimbursed and the negative report on my credit reports removed. I also want the glitch in Synchrony 's online payment system to be fixed and stop blaming it on me!",Closed with monetary relief,5/21/2024

I happened to check my account on XX/XX/XXXX, noticed the fraudulent withdrawal, and immediately called WF to report the fraud. With the help of the banker, the account was closed, and an investigation was initiated.

- I learned that the withdrawal happened inside a branch store on the other side of the city. 
On XX/XX/2024, I called WF to inquire about the status of the investigation. I was told that the fraudster had an I.D., and the signature on the withdrawal receipt matched what was on the I.D . so as far as WF was concerned, this investigation was concluded ; my father immediately contacted the XXXX XXXX. non-emergency operator and asked where to file a police report and was told that it needed to be filed here in XXXX ( Texas ) so we went to the police station and did as directed. 

Also, on or about XX/XX/XXXX, I requested of WF that this issue be escalated to the Customer Advocacy Group for resolution. Because this fraud happened inside the bank and with cameras, I asked if I could send my picture and/or I.D . to show that it wasn't me, but I was told that it wasn't an option. I was told to check back in XXXX working days. 
I called the WF Customer Advocacy Group and was told that they closed the investigation because they determined that my mother, who was a joint-owner on the account, made the withdrawal ( initially, they said it was me ) AND did not file a complaint about the funds being fraudulently taken, so they considered the withdrawal valid and closed the case.

I went individually to the Chase branch in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and informed them of my wish to open a joint checking account. They said that was fine as long as my husband went into another Chase branch and finished opening the account. He went within two days to a branch by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to finish opening the account, and was told by the representative there it was complete. I then proceeded to deposit checks made out to both him and me on the Chase mobile banking app. I deposited a total of {$5300.00}. Unfortunately, the person who was helping my husband did not actually complete registering him for the account despite telling him that he had, and so the checks I deposited that were written to my husband were marked as fraud. My husband returned to that Chase branch to clarify what had happened, we went together to a Chase branch in XXXX XXXX, NY to tell them and provide proof that XXXX XXXX was present with his government issued ID and saying it was not fraud that XXXX XXXX tried to deposit checks written to him from our wedding, and we called the complaint escalation number three times. We were told by everyone that the only way to resolve the fraud complaint was for Chase to contact the people who had written the checks I deposited under my husband 's name and confirm with them that there was no fraud. However, there were {$3100.00} worth of checks I deposited under my husband 's name, each one written in $ XXXX {$300.00} increments, and none of our wedding guests picked up the phone when Chase tried to call them to clarify. As far as we know, they called from an unknown number and Chase would not tell us if they left a voicemail. They also wouldn't tell us if they tried to call the wedding guests more than once. Chase closed the account, refunded me the checks written out to me ( for a total of {$2200.00} ), but still over a year later has not refunded the {$3100.00} in checks written to my husband that I tried to deposit because of this theoretical concern of fraud even though we clarified with them that there was no fraud. The issue was ultimately Chase 's mistake because an employee at their XXXX XXXX branch did not register my husband to the account despite verbally telling him that he had.

Worst experience ever! After banking with this bank for decades, this is how they choose to treat their loyal customers? I disputed these charges as soon as I discovered them on my transaction history. For some reason, the representative in their claim 's department bundled/backdated the recent transactions with a transaction dated XX/XX/XXXX. Remember this date! They issued a temporary credit on the XX/XX/XXXX transactions, only to reverse them due to these transactions being past their 60-day-rule-to-report BASED on the XX/XX/XXXX date! Why on earth would they bundle these XX/XX/XXXX transactions with that one dated XX/XX/XXXX and NEVER disclosing this to me, is beyond comprehension. Make that make sense! They stated that they are only liable for anything within 60 days of the "" first '' transaction. They having bundled the XX/XX/XXXX transactions with the one dated XX/XX/XXXX, changes the XX/XX/XXXX transactions first date to report to XX/XX/XXXX! Are you kidding me?! So I was supposed to report these XX/XX/XXXX transactions no later than XX/XX/XXXX, YET they didn't occur until XX/XX/XXXX?! Again, make that make sense! They denied the transactions in XX/XX/XXXX, which are ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT QUESTION WELL WITHIN the 60 days! Yes, WELL WITHIN THE 60-DAYS!!! Unless I am clairvoyant, which I am not, I would not have known my account would be hacked XXXX months down the line with much larger amounts. Nor would I have waited 6 months to report transactions in XX/XX/XXXX. Their representative 's and management 's reasoning doesn't make sense.

This has caused a tremendous amount of stress and has put my kids and myself in a predicament we never expected coming from Chase. I will also add that 4 representatives I spoke with agreed with me that the recent transactions should never have been bundled with those dated XX/XX/XXXX, but in the end they all stated, "" There's nothing we can do.

After the $ XXXX was in the account for 60 days from the 20th day, there was NO minimum balance requirement, but the account was to remain open until the {$700.00} bonus was paid. Then I could close the account. 

As long as a depositor had not owned a Citibank checking account in the last 180 days, at least XXXX XXXX XXXX, the promo was valid. I met the above requirements to open and receive the {$700.00} promo.

The Citibank website said, for security reasons, we can not allow you to proceed. If you require assistance, please contact Citibank online customer service at XXXX and mention error code XXXX. 

4. I called Citibank immediately. Numerous call attempts to customer service yielded no answers, there were 3 hang ups on me after telling me that my account was being closed but they stated they couldn't discuss my account, and one supervisor from Texas, named XXXX, told me my account was being closed but he couldn't tell me why.

The Texas rep said that the a/c was submitted for closure around XX/XX/XXXX, that he couldn't tell me why, but that I should have received or will be receiving a letter explaining why. I also was told a check would be mailed to me but nobody knows when. 
Therefore, Citibank is using my money while I don't have access.

I called numerous times to try and get an explanation but they said they could not provide me any additional information and that the Citibank Fraud Prevention Department could not be reached for any information regarding their letter.

I went online and Googled if others have had this happen to them and discovered that many people had similar bad experiences with Citibank. 

7. On Saturday XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX left a Citibank envelope on my porch, since I was not home. In the afternoon when I got home I saw the envelope, and in it was a check for my original $ XXXX plus the {$700.00} bonus due, for a total of {$50000.00}. Since my bank was closed when I saw the envelope, and Monday XX/XX/XXXX was XXXX XXXX, I deposited the check on XX/XX/XXXX. 

8. Everything about what Citibank did was unfair, customer unfriendly, deceitful, corrupt, and any other word one chooses to describe all this. The worst part is that Citibank did not have the decency to communicate to me that there was any issue with my account so I could correct any deficiency prior to them forcing my account closure. Citibank closed my valid account on me, without my permission. 

9. If Citibank had not blocked me from accessing my account, on XX/XX/XXXX, the date the $ XXXX needed to stay in the account, I was fully entitled to take all my funds out of the account except for {$1.00}, and invest it into a 1 year t-bill earning 2 %. Because Citibank did block my account from me accessing it, I was unable to utilize my funds, but Citibank was using my money for their own bank lending. 

10. The Massachusetts Consumer Protection law, Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 93A states that unfair or deceptive practices by a business are illegal. I feel that what Citibank did was in my honest opinion, dishonest and corrupt, and should be punished for doing this type of abusive and unfair banking behavior. I feel that Citibank willfully and knowingly violated Chapter 93A. Therefore, I am requesting treble damages as additional compensatory damages for this abuse of my money by Citibank doing business in Massachusetts. 

11. Due to Citibanks actions, they denied me the use of my money from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX, the date I was able to deposit the check, for a total of 45 days. I am requesting Citibank send me a check immediately for the interest income I would have earned on {$49000.00} TIMES treble damages. I would have invested in a 1 year t-bill at 2 %. 

14. To make matters more insulting, in the past month, I have gotten almost a half dozen requests by Citibank Marketing asking me to rate them on how well they have done. Wow!!! I really dont think they want to know what I would like to say. Also the letter sent with the check stated exemplary customer service is our priority at Citibank. We look forward to assisting you in the future. Again, wow!!! 

I have all documentation proving the above and would provide it upon request. Please feel free to request me to scan and send it as an attachment if necessary.

I applied for a loan modification at the end of 2023, and was denied. I was told that because I am not missing payments even though at risk to, I can not get assistance until I do. 
I was offered a deferment. Which meant skip XXXX  months to pay a lump sum of XXXX months at the end. Which kinda sets me up for failure. I was told to sell, defer, and there was no further options for me. 

Can't refinance, can't get loans, because my dti ratio is too high. Because my mortgage is too high, and although I have a good paying job, it's not enough as a single income. 

I paid out XXXX I didn't have, to reduce what I can by removing my mortgage insurance. Unfortunately although XXXX XXXX got my check. They sat on it and waited over a month maybe XXXX, to even submit for the appraisal to remove it. Which delayed the only small reduction I have available to me, by XXXX to 2 months.

This past summer, I saw several large fraudulent purchases that almost maxed out the credit card that I did not identify and called Macy 's to discuss the matter. At the time, they very graciously removed the charges from the account and sent me a new credit card. Shortly thereafter, there was once again a suspicious charge on this new card. I immediately called Macy 's and had the second card cancelled. I paid the remainder of my purchases in full as there was only one concerning charge -- the rest were made by me. Because this was the second time this happened with the Macy 's credit card, I no longer wanted an active account with them as I was worried that somewhere this credit card was being compromised and did not want to deal with this again. I spoke to customer service on the phone who ensured me that the account was paid off in full and the account was closed. This was in XXXX. 

Since then, unbeknownst to me, the account was NOT closed and there were some random fees and late charges being added. I was not even aware that the account was even open for that to be happening. It was not a large amount ( approx XXXX dollars once the fees were added up ), but enough to cause me problems. Once I realized, I called again and spoke to someone who reiterated that my account was in fact closed and that I would not have to pay any of these charges since it was not even open. However, one month later I received another notice that I was delinquent on my account and it would be reported to the credit bureau.

During the period of my open bankruptcy and under the legal protection of the automatic stay, Mr. Cooper/Nationstar egregiously breached bankruptcy laws in the following ways : 1. **Foreclosure Process During Bankruptcy Stay : ** Despite the automatic stay being in effect, Mr. Cooper/Nationstar continued to progress with the foreclosure process. This included hiring inspectors and taking steps towards foreclosure, which is a direct violation of the automatic stay provision under bankruptcy law.

3. **Incorrect Reporting to Credit Bureaus : ** Furthermore, Mr. Cooper/Nationstar inaccurately reported information to credit bureaus during the bankruptcy stay, which has had a detrimental impact on my credit score and financial standing.

XXXX, CA XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Office of Complaint Response XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX, MD XXXX Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau : I am writing to express my concern regarding Wells Fargos practices concerning overdraft fees. There is a systematic pattern of exploiting consumers through excessive and unjustified charges. 

On XX/XX/year> I was slammed with a {$35.00} over draft fee for a pending amount and debit. The basic issue is that Wells Fargo has a practice of reordering debit transactions to increase the likelihood of overdraft fees, along with allowing pending debits to be used to overdraw an account so it triggers overdraft fees on an account. 

Unlike traditional banking practices, Wells Fargo has implemented a policy of routinely processing debit transactions that overdraw accounts and subsequently imposing a {$35.00} overdraft fee, even for minimal amounts. Furthermore Wells Fargo pushes processing and bank cut off posting time several hours into the next day so it possible to incur overdrafts on a debit that has not even posted or occurred that same day. Also, inter account transfers are not posted until after cutoff times, meaning that its better to deposit cash directly into an account than it is to make a transfer between accounts. Cash gets posted immediately, account transfers get posted hours after cutoff times or past posting date. This practice appears to be deliberately designed to maximize revenue rather than to serve the best interests of customers. 

Furthermore, the banks refusal to allow customers to opt out of overdraft protection exacerbates overdrafts. This lack of consumer choice is particularly troubling given the potential financial hardship these fees can cause. 

The practice of reordering transactions to increase the likelihood of overdraft fees is dismaying but it the above patterns of doing business that hurts consumers and creates mistrust of the banking system in general. This manipulation of account activity is unethical and demonstrates a disregard for customers financial well-being. 

I believe these actions constitute unfair and deceptive business practices. Wells Fargos policies are not only financially harmful to consumers but also erode trust in the banking industry.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,Checking or savings account,12/30/2022,IL,"My name is XXXX.I am writing to you with regards to an improper post death disbursement made by Chase Bank. 

My father, XXXX XXXX, passed away on XX/XX/2022. 

At the time of his passing he had a sole owned account ( with no designated beneficiaries ) at Chase Bank, with an approximately {$32000.00} balance as of the date of death. However in early XXXX nearly {$30000.00} was disbursed to an individual present at the Chase Bank Branch located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, IL. 

My father died without a will and the estate was not probated, therefore there is no court appointed administrator to whom the funds could have been distributed. On XX/XX/XXXX I presented a small estate affidavit to Chase to receive the account balance and close the account, and was informed by banker, XXXX XXXX, there was a hold due to social security direct deposits. I checked back frequently for several months and learned in XXXX that Chase permitted someone to make an in-branch withdrawal of all but {$1900.00} of the balance. I contacted Chases executive office to find out what authority that person had to make a withdrawal from my fathers account after his death. Chase responded to my inquiry via voice-mail and provided no details except that [ Chase acted properly ]. 

Two weeks after receiving Chases response to my inquiry, I received a check from Chase for {$1900.00}, the few dollars remaining in the account after the unauthorized withdrawal was permitted. If the individual who was allowed to make a {$30000.00} post death withdrawal from my fathers account had authority to transact on behalf of his estate, why didnt Chase send that person the remaining balance instead of me? I believe Chase acted improperly by allowing an individual without legal authority to conduct a withdrawal transaction, and as such should reimburse my fathers estate and honor the small estate affidavit I submitted to Chase on XX/XX/2022.",Closed with explanation,12/30/2022

This was not necessary. My original car insurance was perfectly fine, even for the van I did not want. Days later, the filthy, defective van two company workers were eating inside of it before it was turned over to us broke down in a mountain and it had to be towed.

I demand that AMEX re-opens this dispute immediately, reviews all the documents I diligently uploaded to their portal, and conducts a rigorous investigation into XXXX XXXX and their misleading consumer/business practices.

CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,Credit card,4/26/2024,NM,"TRANSACTION DENIED : Throw the baby out with the bath water. On XXXX i drove XXXX miles from my rural home to do a much needed quarterly provisioning. I made multiple substantial successful transactions on my Capitalone card. At my XXXX major stop my purchase was declined. To the clerk 's dismay, i had to abandon a bevy of groceries. I then called Capitalone from the store to inquire. They claimed fraudulent activity. ( By days end and XXXX further calls to Capitalone, i ascertained no fraudulent activity. ) Once back home XXXX hours later i found an email sent at the time of this transaction from Capitalone asking me to verify this declined transaction. This i attempted once home XXXX hours later, but their security vendor, XXXX 's, link looped endlessly. This loop thwarted my verification of a valid- albeit declined - purchase. Calpitalone 's reps asked me to verify my identity by answering a cell fone call. I stated repeatedly that i had no cell phone and no alternate land line for a verification call. When they emailed me what was ostensibly a link to upload my driver 's license, their security vendor, XXXX 's, link looped endlessly. Another thwart. They claimed no problems on their end, when i asked. Their so-called verification was thwarted again. Finally i was given a FAX number and a post office box with which to send copies of my driver 's license. XXXX to 10 days without access to my credit card is unacceptable. OPINION : Shutting down my account in the name of fraud - where there is none- is excessively zealous. I support rigorous security measures that actually thwart crime. I had been given no advance warning that traveling XXXX miles to the nearest shopping center would set off their alarms.

Response was I can understand why being on a fixed income that having to pay two months in advance of Escrow would be concerning. I asked for all paperwork to determine if we had indeed been paying 2 months ahead into our Escrow Account but in the mean time received notification that our Escrow Account would be returned to us unless we contacted them by XX/XX/scrub>XX/XX/2024 to stop the ending of the Escrow account. The letter arrived on XX/XX/scrub>XX/XX/2024 and I called them to stop the process of closing the Escrow account.

Then I received a notification by mail saying they did close the Escrow Account & a check would be sent to us for the amount that had been in our Escrow account. I again called asked why did you close our Escrow when you assured me that you would not? They have no information about my previous call but I did have the name of the person I spoke with & date & time of my call. They now say do not make your next month payment until you receive the check then call us back to void it before making your regular monthly payment. I expressed concerns about their untimely paper work and asked are you sure the Escrow check will be here before the next monthly payment is due on XX/XX/2024 and was told it should be here by then. When asking what I should do if the check does not arrive in time I was told to not be concerned. I am concerned since it took 3 months to get even part of the paperwork I asked for months earlier.

During this visit, I was exposed to multiple advertisements and was recommended by the XXXX to use Care Credit as some sort of an interest-free financing option. Believing it to be a viable, interest-free alternative for my situation, I applied for and received a Care Credit card, which I used to pay for services on multiple occasions. 

Upon reviewing my account statement Today XXXX XXXX XXXX, I was shocked to discover an "" XXXX Charge on Purchases '' totaling {$250.00}. This charge contradicts the primary reason I chose to use Care Credit, based on the understanding and advertisement that it was an interest-free option. 

The problems with this situation are twofold. Firstly, the promotion of Care Credit within healthcare facilities as an interest-free credit option comes with incredibly limited disclosure about the terms, particularly concerning for patients in distress or under duress, as I was at the time of the XXXX XXXX. Secondly, there appears to be a significant lack of effort on the part of Care Credit to communicate the specifics of the interest-free terms, including the duration of the interest-free period and the consequences of not paying the full amount by the deadline. This lack of communication led to a misunderstanding of the interest-free deadline 's implications, resulting in unexpected and substantial interest charges. 

I was under the impression that "" interest-free '' meant no interest would be accrued during the specified period and that if the balance was not paid in full by the end of this period, interest would then begin to accrue. However, I was not aware that failing to pay the full amount by the deadline would result in retroactive interest charges for the entire period, all at once. 

This incident has not only imposed unexpected financial hardship but also starkly highlights what I perceive as predatory lending practices. The lack of transparency and adequate communication about the critical terms of the interest-free period has led to a significant and unforeseen financial burden. 
If this situation doesn't constitute predatory lending, then I'm unsure what does. I urge the CFPB to address these concerns with Care Credit to ensure greater transparency and to assist in resolving this distressing financial situation.",Closed with monetary relief,4/4/2024

"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",Checking or savings account,3/30/2024,FL,"On XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX  XXXX located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Florida. XXXX denied me access to my funds in my account. They denied me access to my ATM daily limit withdrawal amount. When I tried to take less than my daily limit they restricted my card access. When I called they advised I need to speak with their fraud department. XXXX, BOA fraud employee thought the entire situation was hilarious. BOA customer service and telephone wait times are ridiculous. 

I feel BOA is also participating in unethical, unfair, and deceptive business practices with their dispute process. They do not provide the temporary credit to your account as promised. BOA will not allow me to file my dispute process online, in my own words ; Although they advertise that I can and has sent me links to do so in the past. Whenever I try to submit a dispute via Bank of XXXX  XXXX  I receive a message that I MUST CALL BOA TO FILE A DISPUTE. I feel this allows BOA employees to write the dispute for you. Thus us totally unfair and deceptive. Are they writing my dispute it in a way that I lose and the company wins. I believe that is exactly what BOA is doing. BOA is not being unbiased during this process and 99 % of the time BOA unfairly sides with the merchant. 
Another thing I noticed is when there is a hold on your account BOA alleges the charge falls off, however it appears your account balance never reflects that change. I feel this company is blatantly victimizing customers in the XXXX of Florida with no accountability. I strongly feel XXXX XXXX Florida and the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX tolerate, welcome, and encourage this unethical treatment if CERTAIN residents. I feel XXXX XXXX and the XXXX of XXXX needs investigating as well for XXXX XXXX  and discrimination, On XX/XX/XXXX several BOA representatives from sent my family on a wild goose chase from bank to bank and continuously denying us access. I feel Bank of America is using fraud checks to victimize and take advantage of their own customers. The public embarrassment was unbearable. BOA XXXX department Representatives sent my family to about XXXX different BOA Branch ATMs alleging I will now be able to withdraw my own funds ; BOA was dishonest as usual, All ATM withdrawals were still being declined after I completed Fraud Verification Process. 


I reported this incident of XXXX profiling to several government agencies I received a call from someone in BOA fraud or XXXX department.. I think he said his name was XXXX. 

That call did not go well at all. XXXX was not receptive and tried to downplay the entire ordeal. He was very rude, insensitive, and sarcastic. Instead of being unbiased and receptive to diffuse and resolve the situation, he took it all personal and could not control his anger when I was speaking my truth ; instead he decided to pour gasoline on an already lit fire. He was biased and on the defensive from the beginning of the call. XXXX actions confirmed to me that this is a part of Bank of Americas normal practice towards CERTAIN customers. 

See attachments of acknowledgement of receipt if complaint from various agencies. 

This bank unfairly and deceptively reported to XXXX that I did not meet cash back requirements and caused my credit score to decrease after only having the card for one month. My credit score was over XXXX until I got this credit card with Bank of America. 

If my ATM daily withdrawal limit is {$1500.00} why did BOA restrict my card usage/privileges when I tried to withdraw {$500.00} from the ATM. See attachments This restriction also prevented me from getting gas and food for my family. BThis is so unfair to my entire family. 

Another issue with BOA. They are doing fraud checks when customers are trying to get gas. A lot of times the verification process does not work and then you are unable to use your card. Again, being denied access to your own available funds.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,Credit card,7/3/2024,UT,"I am filing this complaint regarding a dispute with my CHASE VISA BUSINESS UNLIMITED CARD. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I mistakenly paid the HOA fees for another resident due to an address error, resulting in two incorrect charges : {$1900.00} to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
{$880.00} to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
After realizing the mistake, I disputed the charges with CHASE. On XX/XX/XXXX, after the HOA agreed to transfer the fees to my account, I closed the dispute. However, CHASE had already returned the payments to my account. The HOA now states that they never received the funds after CHASE canceled the dispute on XX/XX/XXXX. 

CHASE has given me conflicting information, with the latest being that the fees were sent to the HOA again on XX/XX/XXXX and are supposedly with the HOA 's bank. However, CHASE refuses to refund the fees or provide any further solution, claiming we are beyond their policy window for disputes. The HOA requested a trace number or a transaction number to validate and locate the XX/XX/XXXX payment. 

I have spent four hours on customer service calls with CHASE, being transferred multiple times and even hung up on. Despite my efforts, CHASE refuses to provide any verification for the XX/XX/XXXX payment. 

Meanwhile, my new HOA fees are due on XX/XX/XXXX, and I had to pay again to avoid late fees. I am stuck in a stalemate, with the HOA stating they can not see the payment, and CHASE claiming that they sent the payment on XX/XX/XXXX but can not provide any more details or cancel or dispute it again. 

As a result, I am out {$2700.00} and am unable to resolve this issue. I am seeking assistance to recover my funds, as neither CHASE nor the HOA is willing to help me locate the missing payment.",Closed with explanation,7/3/2024
CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,Credit card,8/5/2024,NC,"XX/XX/year>, a fraudulent charge appeared on my account. I disputed this. Capital One closed the dispute without any communication to me. I called their customer service line over 10 times. Finally ( XX/XX/year> ) someone told me that I had to submit additional documentation ( the first time I was told this ), and that the dispute could be reopened and investigated once I did that. I did so immediately ; however, the dispute was NEVER reopened or investigated, and not a single piece of communication ever sent to me regarding the issue. I have contested this multiple times. Each time I file a complaint, they say that they need several MONTHS to investigate ; however, the charge is accumulating interest during this time. The first month, I made a partial payment because the charge was very large and I didn't want anything to negatively affect my perfect credit. However, Capital One is blatantly trying to frustrate their customers into giving up and that will not happen with me. Now, Capital One is saying my payment is late, missed, and etc etc that I owe a balance, when IT IS ALL FROM A FRAUDULENT CHARGE AND THEY OWE ME THE PARTIAL PAYMENT I MADE IN THE BEGINNING. Between XX/XX/year> and today I have called Capital One another 20 times and either can not get through or each person tells me something wildly different ( they have no idea and seem to make it up as they go ). 

FURTHER, ever since this occurred, I have been unable to log into my account online. It prompts me to create a new password, which I then do - making it the same existing password, which works- but it has me to through the entire password creation process EVERY SINGLE TIME, meaning every time I want to check my account it takes at least 15 minutes to log in.

Citi did send me emails and left an auto mssg. But by the time I was able to respond, I'd already been charged multiple fees.

DISCOVER BANK,Credit card,6/3/2024,PA,"Discover Card has revoked my account. When I was discussing the details with them today. They said that it was due to "" failure to meet the minimum financial requirements '' when I asked what this meant they gave only a vague answer and said that it was permanent and irreversible. 

Firstly, they did not provide adequate notice that the account was going to be revoked nor provided an opportunity for me to fix the issue. They claim that "" communication was sent in XXXX '' however, checking my month 's previous mail they did not provide any written notice via XXXX. There was a secured message on my Discover online account form XX/XX/year> however, Discover has locked the account and I can not read what the message says. 

Secondly, I contest exactly what they mean by "" failure to meet the minimum financial obligations '' I entered into a repayment agreement with a credit consolidation company in XXXX and Discover rejected the agreement, again I was only given a vague reason. The purpose for entering into the agreement was to consolidate my credit and get lower interest. If Discover is interpreting entering into a repayment agreement, this as a failure to meet financial obligations then they are misunderstanding me. 

Also, I was a commissioned based salesperson who for a period of a couple months, received extremely low pay. I tried contacting Discover to apply for an emergency forbearance, again because they locked the secure message center on my account, and I couldn't provide my paystubs as proof of financial hardship. 

Also, Discover mishandled a fraud claim. I tried contacting a merchant who kept recurring billing me. When they would not respond, I contacted Discover get a new card issued so the merchant would quit billing it. Instead of reporting it as fraud, the Discover agent reported the card lost/stolen so the merchant was able to continue billing it.

There are two accounts ending in XXXX and XXXX I sent a letter to Chase at the end of XXXX. They received my letter because they sent me a response dated XX/XX/XXXX but only mentioned account XXXX. 

I received a 60 day late payment on my personal credit report about account ending XXXX which is a business card. In the letter they said they could not find the transaction I mentioned but that was a vague response. I called their offices as well and spoke to agent who did not give me much information I said I would call back at a later time. 

The process is difficult trying to sort out a billing issue and now I've been denied a credit application ( adverse action ) because of a 60 day late payment which is a false statement. 

I believe this very unfair as the Fair credit billing act says they can not charge me any interest or late fees for 60 days but they did as you can see on the statements. 

Even though it is a business card they either are not required to follow the FCBA so then it should also not be a negative mark on my personal credit card or either dthey do need to comply with the FCBA and the FCRA.

"CITIBANK, N.A.",Checking or savings account,10/4/2022,IL,"This complaint is regarding closure of 3 accounts due to what I am being told is a violation of the terms of the account involving the appearance of fraud. I got a letter from Citi regarding the closures. I made 30 or 40 attempts to call. Most of the people i talked to said they couldnt tell me anything ; one employee was able to help me figure out that the issues involved a {$15000.00} transaction made in late XXXX and early XX/XX/XXXX. I made many requests for someone at Citi to call me but I never received any calls. 

I have been an account holder with Citi since XXXX, for 35 years. I did not commit fraud. What occurred was as follows. 

I wanted to transfer {$15000.00} to my husbands account at XXXX XXXX XXXX 

On XX/XX/XXXX, she transferred {$16000.00} from her XXXX savings account to her Citi account ending in XXXX ( {$15000.00} to give to her husband, {$1000.00} I kept for unrelated purposes ). 

I had planned to use XXXX in her Citi account to send money to my husband and discovered that she could not send that high amount by XXXX. So I transferred {$15000.00} to my husband using XXXX. The account ending in XXXX is the account I use for XXXX. 

When using XXXX, the transaction came back reading as if the transaction had been a {$15000.00} payment to a vendor. I did not feel comfortable with this transaction being categorized as a payment from a customer to a merchant, so I cancelled the transaction. 

I called Citi to explain. I was told I would receive a {$15000.00} provisional credit. This was what Citi advised me should happen. It wasnt at my request ; I was only trying to inform Citi and make sure I was doing everything right. 

I also was credited {$15000.00} by XXXX. This led to an over-credit of {$15000.00} in my account. I informed Citi to take the provisional credit of {$15000.00} back and I was told that would be done and this issue closed. 

I then wrote my husband a personal check for {$15000.00} ( check XXXX ). 


As an additional problem beyond the account closures, I was told I would not get the balances belonging to me returned. In a similar pattern to my phone calls regarding the closure, I was not able to get any information that makes much sense and my requests for a call from someone who can help go unanswered. I t was told at one point I will not get my money back because it doesnt appear to belong to me. At another point I was told it was sent back where it came from. 

Other than a {$600.00} payroll deposit on XX/XX/XXXX, the rest of the funds in her accounts should not fit the category of being returned. I am also due {$200.00} from XXXX, {$25.00} from XXXX and {$250.00} from XXXX. Plus, the {$600.00} payroll deposit that she informs me has not been sent back. 

As stated, I have been an account holder since XXXX. I did not commit any kind of intentional fraud or rule infraction. It appears that this is a case where Citis algorithms led to an inaccurate result. 

I ask for an explanation of the specific activity that led to the decision and the specific account terms alleged to be violated. Further, I was told I was sent a letter XX/XX/XXXX. I did not receive it, nor did I receive the copy I was told would be sent.",Closed with monetary relief,10/19/2022

I immediately went through my online banking and responded back that it was not me and it was a fraud then the fraud department started a claim for me while I was on the phone with them and suggested I open a new account and transfer my available funds to a new account to avoid further fraud so I opened another account by one of customer service agent online ( through ) and transfer my funds to the new account.

Upon reviewing my credit report, I noticed that late payments have been reported.

I firmly believe that the reported late payments on my account were, in fact, made on time and have adversely affected my credit score. 

The impact of these incorrect late payment reports has been significant.

U.S. BANCORP,Checking or savings account,6/11/2025,CA,"I am XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have been a loyal customer of U.S. Bank for over 15 years. I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding the mishandling of my personal checking accounts by U.S. Bank, which has caused me ongoing financial hardship, emotional stress, and deep concern for my safety and well-being. 

In XX/XX/year>, all three of my checking accounts were frozen without any prior notice or explanation. I was later told this was due to suspicious activity involving XXXX U.S. Bank employees. Despite this situation not being my fault, I was given no warning, no communication, and no assistance. For nearly a month, I was denied access to my own funds, which led to late rent payments, overdue utility bills, and the accumulation of fees I could not avoid. As a senior citizen living on a fixed income, this was incredibly distressing. 

During that period, I made multiple visits to my local U.S. Bank branch in an effort to understand and resolve the issue. Each time, I was told that my accounts were locked, and no withdrawals could be made. I requested to speak with the branch XXXX on each visit, but I was always told she was either unavailable, in a meeting, or out to lunch. I was given no meaningful support. It was only after repeated attempts that I was finally able to meet with the branch XXXX, XXXX XXXX, who accessed my accounts and allowed me to withdraw funds. She also informed me that I could have been allowed to make smaller withdrawals during my earlier visits something none of the other staff had shared with me. This was upsetting, as I had endured unnecessary financial and emotional hardship due to this lack of accurate information and support. 

Shortly afterward, XXXX XXXX opened a new checking account for me so I could move my funds while the fraud investigation was ongoing. I was told I would need to wait for this account to be fully approved before any deposits or transfers could occur. I also noticed monthly fees on this new account fees that I had never been charged on my previous accounts. I was never informed about these charges beforehand, and to this day, no one has been able to clearly explain what they are for. 

Then, during a recent visit to the bank to withdraw cash from this new account, the teller loudly counted out my money and announced my remaining balance in front of others waiting in line. This lack of discretion made me feel extremely unsafe. As an elderly woman, having my financial information shared publicly put me at risk. I left the bank feeling fearful and vulnerable, worried that someone could follow or target me. 

More recently, I was told I would be contacted by XXXX XXXX regarding the possibility of redirecting my scheduled deposits for XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX to my new account. I was later informed she was on vacation for a week, and instead, I spoke with XXXX XXXX. She assured me that she would call me on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX to let me know if my deposits could be redirected. That call never came. After hearing nothing, I called the XXXX XXXX Department again and spoke with XXXX, who said she would send a memo to the XXXX Back XXXX and confirmed that the funds would be redirected. As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, this still has not happened. My deposits remain unaccounted for, and I continue to face delays in paying my rent and essential bills because of these ongoing issues. 

Additionally, I previously wrote and mailed a letter regarding this matter on XX/XX/year>, but I later found out it was sent to the wrong address. 

What has been most disheartening throughout this process is the complete lack of transparency, poor customer service, and absence of accountability. I have tried repeatedly to resolve this matter through the banks internal channels, yet I have been met with misinformation, delays, and broken promises. At this point, my new account has also been closed, and I am once again struggling to stabilize my finances through no fault of my own. 

I would also like to raise an important concern about the district XXXX responsible for overseeing this branch. I have asked for contact information to escalate my complaint further, but I was told that customers are not allowed to access this information. I must ask : what is a district XXXX good for customers like me if they are completely inaccessible and protected from direct contact? When bank-level support fails, we should have a way to reach someone with higher authority to intervene but that option has been kept from me. 

As a XXXX woman, I feel not only let down, but deeply disrespected and unsafe. I am asking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate XXXX Banks handling of this matter and to take appropriate steps to ensure they are held accountable. I am also asking that they improve their customer service especially when dealing with elderly and vulnerable customers and ensure proper training regarding privacy, professionalism, and responsiveness. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to a prompt response outlining the actions that will be taken to address these concerns and to prevent similar situations in the future.",Closed with non-monetary relief,6/11/2025

Their own documents indicate requesting thousands of dollars of "" Unbilled Attorney fees '' and their request for "" Pending '' amounts violates the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act. Their reconciliations show they collected thousands of dollars not due to them and their reinstatement figures were materially overstated. During this period of alleged default and not actual fees having been assessed, Wells Fargo furnished negative information to the credit reporting agencies which continues to be furnished through today. These furnishings have prevented me from refinancing my financial obligations as well as indicating to other lenders that I was a credit risk. During the alleged default, they continued to prepare court filings that indicated they were due amounts that had not been incurred.

When I requested proof of debt, the supervisor argued that the monthly statements constituted sufficient proof of debt and that my payments on the account implied my acceptance of the debt. I explained that I only continued making payments to protect my credit score, not as an acknowledgment of the debts accuracy.

According to XXXX XXXX XXXX, a statement is a written or printed account of something, whereas according to XXXX XXXX XXXX, a bond is a promise or written obligation to pay a sum of money. Similarly, a coupon is a detachable portion of a bond or other certificate that can be redeemed for payment. 
I have come to notice that by accepting both the coupon and a physical payment, Discover is engaging in double dipping. This appears to be a form of Trust fraud, as you are not only receiving payment against my trust, but also accepting a check separately. However, I am willing to overlook this issue under the condition that my accounts be reopened with updated credit lines. 

I have sent numerous coupons in the past, all of which have not been returned to me. This is seen as your automatic acceptance of the coupons, as I have kept a record of all the coupons that I have submitted, in which all of the coupons were endorsed with my beneficiary signature. According to the Rule of common law contract, these coupons are redeemable and should be used to settle my debt. As these coupons were sent via certified mail, Discover has contractually agreed, through the postal rule, to accept them.

I kindly request that you look into this matter and ensure that my accounts are reopened with updated credit lines. I trust that you will address this issue promptly and appropriately.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I called capital one travel ( ( XXXX ) XXXX ) to help me with cancellation on XX/XX/XXXX. Every time they will give some reason to not provide me refund of points. I even provided them the cancellation approval from hotel on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX the customer representative said I will get a decision within 72 hrs after talking to vendor who arranges the booking. When I called on XX/XX/XXXX, ( ie after 72 hrs ) they said 24 hrs more. So I called XX/XX/XXXX. Now the resolution wait time became 14 days as they didnt get any response from their vendor. So I requested a temporary credit of my points as the delay they are having is not due to my fault. My concerns : 1. They never gave a proper XXXX XXXX. Its more than 10 days after I submitted documentation and still no resolution for my dispute. 
3. They are not allowing me to directly talk to booking.com ( capital ones vendor partner for this reservation ) as I need booking.com reservation and PIN to reach out to booking.com directly. 
4.. If they had given me cancellation within 7 days I had an international insurance through which I could have requested refund. 
5. Earlier I requested capital one to help multiple things and never got any help in spite they say they offer those features like a. activate XXXX wallet - I still can activate XXXX wallet as their team said they couldnt validate my phone. I have other visa and Amex cards added to XXXX wallet. b. Update name on a hotel reservation. After 1 week of unsuccessful waiting, I finally directly fixed it by calling the hotel in 10 minutes. 

So I feel they are stalling the process and would never resolve it. 

Please you could help expedite the process and have the points refunded as the hotel, XXXXXXXX XXXX readily approved my cancellation without any penalty. 

Attached approval from hotel and proof of capital one receiving the approval document. Please let me know if you need any more documentation.

"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",Checking or savings account,6/17/2024,NY,"In XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America withdrew {$730.00} from my checking account without my authorization or prior notice. This transaction was labeled as "" offset payment to acct XXXX. '' These funds were taken due to a debt supposedly owed by my father, XXXX, connected to his old company, which has been closed down. 

My father set up my student checking account as a joint account years ago. Despite him no longer being associated with Bank of America and having resolved his debts, these payments were erroneously taken from my account. This has caused me significant financial hardship over the past few months, resulting in financial strain and additional expenses due to insufficient funds. 

On XXXX XXXX XXXX, another unauthorized withdrawal of {$240.00} occurred under the same description, "" offset payment to acct XXXX. '' A few days later, in XXXX, I contacted Bank of America 's customer service with my Dad on the line, and they assured us that the funds would be returned within 14 business days. The {$240.00} was refunded, but the {$730.00} from XXXX has not been returned. 

Today, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX my father and I spent two hours on the phone with Bank of America trying to understand how we can get the {$730.00} returned to my account. We were escalated up, kept asking to speak with supervisors until eventually reaching a supervisor who stated it is the bank 's policy to take offset payments from my account. The supervisor could not explain why the {$240.00} was refunded but claimed there was no request in the system to reverse these payments, so neither should have been returned. On one call, the bank says these offsets were erroneous and the money would be returned. Then about a month later, after only returning one payment, the Bank says actually none of the offsets are reversible and I should never have been refunded the {$240.00} in the first place. They want to explain to us that they are on top of this situation yet they can't even answer why my account was refunded partially in the first place. I just want the remaining {$730.00} returned yet when we spoke to the last supervisor just now they made me feel helpless, tiny, and bullied quite frankly in trying to get this accomplished. I understand since this is a joint account between my XXXX and I that he may need to share information to verify his side of this story, so if there's any info you need from us please let me know. 

This situation has caused considerable stress and financial difficulty for me. I seek the return of the {$730.00} taken in XXXX and compensation for the financial hardship caused by these unauthorized transactions. 

Explanation of Documents I uploaded XXXX XXXX is my XXXX bank statement, see highlighted row on page 4 to see where BoA reversed one of the offset payments, returning {$240.00} to me. On page 8 of XXXX you can see the row on XX/XX/year> when this money was taken from my account with the description "" Offset payment to acct XXXX ''. 
XXXX is my XXXX bank statement, see highlighted row on XX/XX/XXXX entitled "" Offset payment to acct XXXX '' for - {$730.00}. This is the transaction I want reversed. 
-XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX contains pictures of the receipts I got from sending certified mail to Bank of America customer service as well as a copy of the letter I had sent to BoA in XXXX right after my first long call with them after discovering these offset payments. To reiterate, I have had {$240.00} returned to my account from the bank, but not the {$730.00}. When I called back today to ask about the {$730.00}, my Dad and I were being gaslit by the bank, saying they wont return it and that the {$240.00} should never have been returned either. That they have nothing in their system that says anyone issued any reversal or claim for any of this. 
XXXX XXXX  XXXX is a copy of the letter I am sending to Bank of America today which details the update to the situation ( having had the {$240.00} offset payment returned but not the {$730.00} offset payment returned ) and details the inconsistency with Bank of America 's handling of this situation. 

I have dealt with a large number of overdraft fees and missed payments and putting the pieces together it's becoming clear to me that missing this money from my account all of these months has put me in more severe financial strain and hardship than warranted. My Dad and I were loyal customers of Bank of America for a long time but that is coming to and end.

After getting bounced around, eventually the checking back office and savings back office had a phone conference and the customer service agent updated me that the credit was processed as a debit on the checking account side and that is why it was not credited.

7. I did not receive my funds back by XXXX  end of business. I called customer service and they said they need to escalate it to the back office and it can only be looked into on the next business day on XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX when the back office is open. 

It has been 4+ days and my funds are still missing when they claim that the transfer will arrive instantly.

My check was in fact sent more than 10 days prior to the due date, and yet didnt clear until 16 days after the due date. And even though I had disputed my account, they continued to assess additional late fees and minimum interest payments. To put an end to that cycle, I did go ahead and pay the additional late fees, then received yet another bill with a minimum interest charge of {$2.00}. So I paid that, knowing that if I didnt there would be yet another late fee.

She looked irritated and had me sit down and asked me, did you read the conditions to get the bonus? I said yes. She said, so you're going to have direct deposit? I said no, I'll do the funds transfer. She said, so you'll bring in the amount? I said, no, I'll do an online transfer. She said, so you have the amount? I said yes. Then she told me to sit in another chair because she was busy with somebody else. I walked out. 

Four times she treated me like an XXXX : First, she asked if I had read the conditions ( of course ) ; second for saying, then you'll do the direct deposit?

Furthermore the reduction in credit limit impacts my entire credit portfolio as this card has the largest credit limit of all of my cards. I am in the beginning stages of trying to buy a new home and thanks to Citi, this may not even be possible due to the harm they have caused. I think it is absolutely horrendous practice. While speaking with an agent today, I was informed that Citi is well within their right to decrease a credit limit as they see fit. I was admittedly very upset and had a few choice words for the initial agent I spoke with, whom ultimately thought my situation was not important enough to take seriously as she laughed at me while on the phone. I demanded to speak with a supervisor. She has stated that she would submit an appeal to have my credit limit restored. This practice is completely unfair and has ruined my future plans and all I did was pay my bills responsibly. Shame on Citi bank for treating a long time customer whom had never even made a late payment so poorly.",Closed with explanation,4/10/2024

XXXX is XXXX XXXX XXXX. I am writing about a Citi Card I transferred a large balance to for 0 % interest. I attached my checking account to it to set up auto payments. They use a system called XXXX  to connect clients bank accounts for payments. When I did this, I clicked the account I wanted as my kids have account connected with mine. 
For my May payment they credited {$250.00}, then the next day put it back on my balance and charged a return check fee. They told me XXXX bank denied it. I followed up with XXXX and they said they never got a request and never denied. I then saw my payment account. There were two accounts and the numbers were all wrong. Their Plaid system had got it wrong.

It has taken 4 calls to get the {$30.00} fee removed. The last call, they said they would remove the interest fee ( they charged interest on the {$30.00} ). They charged {$.00} interest for {$30.00} fee. They only credited me {$.00}!!! 
Ive tried and tried to fix this. It doesnt seem like much, but I have a large balance I transferred with 0 % interest. That small amount will continue to compound until I pay the entire balance as it pays the XXXX interest items first. So I am going to accrue charges continually for something that was caused by their faulty system. Ive explained this on multiple calls, yet no one is fixing it properly. 
Please intervene for me. Im very frustrated and think they might be doing this on purpose as many people just give up. Companies can make a lot of money this way.

I also get notified about certain price increases that have occurred due to things like high energy use for any given month. 

The paperless option provided by Comenity Bank feels like a trap. They are banking on consumers forgetting the date to which they need to pay the amount in full so that they can begin raking in the interest at XXXX XXXX. 

Furthermore, the user interface on their application did not work when I attempted to set up automatic payments. I had to call in and set it up because the interface simply would not function.

"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",Credit card,3/8/2024,CA,"Bank of America does not provide the option for credit card holders to pay above the minimum on their credit card balances using the autopay feature. This is an unethical practice because it penalizes members who can not pay their full balance each month and are therefore required to pay more in interest and fees. Bank of America is building wealth off those who are least able to pay their full balance, thereby giving wealthier customers additional privileges. 

I opened a new credit card account last fall and immediately set up autopay. Unbeknownst to me, autopay does not go into effect for two billing cycles, which I learned from a customer service representative today. As a result, a couple of payments were late. Upon realizing that the payment was late, I immediately paid {$1500.00} toward the bill and attempted to increase my minimum payment to a larger amount. Bank of America restricted this option, and I could only select to make the minimum payment. The bank also reduced my credit limit and reported on my credit report. This is all within 6 months of opening the account. 

I spoke to a representative this morning who said that Bank of America turned off the option to make more than the minimum payment. This means that customers who are not able to pay the full balance each month are paying more interest and paying over a longer period of time, which is very unethical. I have several credit cards that I have been using and managing for over a decade and have never had any of these issues. My credit score is in the mid-700s, a testament to my commitment to managing my finances well. It's unbelievable that I have to request to pay more than the minimum on my account to pay off the balance faster, which is in my best interest.

To make matters worse along with the supporting documentation they included indicating this was the reason why it was decided the dispute was in the merchants favor, none of the documentation belonged to me. The signed agreement was in someone elses name, the Drivers license included which contains PII did not even come close to my name or address. This is a clear indication this case was brushed off and was automatically determined to be in merchants favor without proper and reasonable investigation. At all costs avoiding having to resolve this in a sensitive manner as it should have. If I mistakenly received someone else 's personal information, this makes me concerned on how my data is being managed without a guarantee it is not being exposed.

CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,Credit card,5/13/2024,MN,"I am writing to file a complaint against Capital One regarding the reporting of my business credit card, specifically the Capital One Spark Card, to my personal credit profile. 

I applied for the Capital One Spark Card for business purposes, and prior to applying, I thoroughly reviewed the terms and conditions as well as the frequently asked questions provided by Capital One. OnXXXX specific question that I paid close attention to spoke directly to why the application requires the business owner to include their personal information as follows : "" Why do you need my personal information? '' it states : We need your personal information for two reasons. Federal law requires us to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. As a result, your personal information is required and used for identification purposes. We use your personal information like social security number to pull your credit bureau data, which in turn is used with other information like annual income in processing your application. 

However, I have encountered an issue wherein the Capital One Spark Card, which is designated for business use, has begun reporting to my personal credit profile, and having a significant adverse impact on my personal credit profile and score. 

The language provided in the terms and conditions does not adequately address this issue. While it does mention authorization for the exchange of credit information between Capital One and its affiliates, it does not explicitly state that the business card will report to the personal credit profile of the cardholder. 

This is in stark contrast to the clear and conspicuous language found in the terms and conditions of my personal XXXX XXXX credit cards as an example. My personal credit cards explicitly state that by applying for the credit card account, "" I agree to the reporting of information about the account to consumer reporting agencies ''. Such clarity is lacking in the terms and conditions of the Capital One Spark Card. 

This discrepancy has raised concerns for me as it affects my personal credit profile, which is separate from my business finances. I believe that Capital One 's failure to clearly communicate and disclose this aspect of the credit card agreement is misleading and deceptive. 

I hereby request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and take appropriate action to ensure that Capital One rectifies this issue. Additionally, I request that Capital One review and revise its terms and conditions to provide clear and transparent information regarding the reporting of business credit cards to personal credit profiles. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and resolution of this issue.",Closed with explanation,5/13/2024

I disputed a purchase of two ( 2 ) online XXXX XXXX eTickets on my CITI Card in the amount of {$5700.00} ( {$2800.00} x 2 ) on the grounds that the etickets were not delivered on time, not used and therefore I did not receive the benefits. CITI Card refused to reject the charges. 

CITI Card relied on XXXX XXXX assertion that the travelers failed to show at the departure gate on XXXX on the date and time for the departure. CITI Card refused and/or ignored the documentary facts I presented to them which clearly reflected errors on the eTickets that we discovered after reviewing the eTickets ; significant changes including name and route ) and the fact that the eTickets were not available on time for the scheduled departure date and time. 

XXXX XXXX did confirm our reservation request as per Booking Confirmation ref no. # XXXX ; Mon XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and return. 

XXXX XXXX emailed the eTickets on Tuesday XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, for my wife and daughter originating from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and return. 

Note : The passengers left XXXX already on Monday XX/XX/XXXX as scheduled. According to International date line, the US is a day behind XXXX. 

The errors on the eTickets included my daughters name and the route to XXXX was not possible for my wife because her passport had expired. The confirmed reservation made by XXXX XXXX themselves was XXXX to XXXX via XXXX and not XXXX. 

I have to purchase two ( 2 ) separate XXXX XXXX tickets for my wife and daughter to meet the scheduled / confirmed reservation. The flight schedule was very important for my wife to meet medical appointment with XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX Texas. 

I filed a formal complaint to the United States Department of Transportation Aviation Consumer Protection Division ( DOT ACPD ) at which time XXXX XXXX Corporate Customer Service did not waste time to issue a refund without further inquiry. Only then CITI Card follow through with a full credit of the principal amount only. It took about one year to resolve the dispute. 

My experience with CITI Card on similar issue has been very favorable. When I complaint about not receiving the goods I purchased online, I was given immediate credit. It was the companys fault. That was a small company. When I filed a complaint about XXXX XXXX, it was my fault ; as if my fault the big airline made those mistakes. 

I am grateful DOT ACPD intervene on this Dispute. 

2nd Dispute. I also filed a follow-up dispute on the related finance charges in excess of {$2500.00} accumulated over the investigation period. 

CITI Bank Customer Service Team responded with a {$41.00} credit / refund on the Late Fee, but I am not eligible for a credit on the disputed finance charges. 

I wrote them an Appeal but as of this date, CITI Bank Corporate Customer Service Team has not responded. 

Please see details below. 

CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU COMPLAINT What Happen - Important events and activities in chronological order : Tues XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX Requested Reservation and Response Booking Confirmation No. XXXX XXXX to XXXX via XXXX / XXXX XXXX flight XXXX to XXXX via XXXX XXXX ( see attached Email XX/XX/XXXX XXXX to XXXX from XXXX Sent Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Texas ) XX/XX/XXXX Initial charges of {$280000.00} twice or {$5700.00} total. 

Payment processed and secured via Credit Card XXXX XXXX XXXX Citi Card ending XXXX, {$5700.00} = ( {$2800.00} x 2 ) The Reservation Confirmation No. XXXX sent to my daughter via email were correct as requested. 

No further communication from XXXX ; no eTickets issue/ receive despite payment made. 

As the departure date gets closer and after failed multiple attempts to contact designated party in connection with XXXX, and in desperation thereof we purchased another set of XXXX XXXX tickets through a local travel agent in order to meet medical appointment at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Texas. 

In the meantime, I filed my dispute with CITI Card to have the eTickets rejected because we did not use the eTickets.. 

XX/XX/XXXX Conditional credit was issued for {$570000.00} in accordance to Citi Card Dispute Policy. 

XX/XX/XXXX Conditional Credit reversed ; account recharged for the same amount of {$5700.00}. 

Mon XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Check in with XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX and departed to XXXX using separate locally purchased XXXX XXXX tickets. 

Tues XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Itinerary, Confirmation Code and eTickets were emailed from XXXX Texas. 

Upon review of the eTickets, my daughter discovered errors on the eTickets that render the eTickets even much more useless. Errors include ( 1 ) eTickets emailed and arriving after the check-in time and date, ( 2 ) The Itinerary and eTickets were wrong, ( 3 ) my daughters last name was wrong ; does not match passport name ; significant changes. 

( 1 ) Check-in time and date was XXXX XXXX Monday XX/XX/XXXX. The eTickets were sent via email on Tuesday at XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. SEVERAL DAYS LATE. 
( 2 ) The Itinerary as it appears on the eTickets erroneously rerouted to XXXX which was an impossibility for my wife because her US Passport expired. The ticketing agent erroneously failed to follow the Confirmation Code No. XXXX. 
( 3 ) My daughters last name on her eTicket was XXXX, should have been XXXX as it appears on the original Reservation Confirmation Code. 

The account went through three ( 3 ) stages of investigation procedure which included the issuances of three ( 3 ) conditional credits and reversals and concluded along with XXXX XXXX reasonings that the travelers were at fault for not showing up at the XXXX XXXX checking counter. 

XXXX XXXX should be able to verify the travelers departure because they departed XXXX on time on board XXXX XXXX using XXXX XXXX tickets, but not the eTickets. 

The entire investigation process went on for the lapsed duration of time from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. 

Error No. One. XXXX XXXX asserted that the travelers failed to show up at the airport for the departure checking time scheduled for XXXX Monday XX/XX/XXXX. 

Correction. The travelers had already departed XXXX when the eTickets were emailed on Tuesday morning. 

Error No. Two. XXXX XXXX asserted that the travelers failed to follow XXXX XXXX policies and applicable protocols. 

Correction. My daughter made multiple attempts to contact designated party to inform XXXX XXXX of the late and wrong eTickets, but all failed. She was not able to reach the designated party, XXXX XXXX. Even if the eTickets were non-refundable, XXXX XXXX mage significant changes to the original confirmed reservation without my knowledge or my approval. 

Error No. Three. Citi Card asserted that I failed to show any documentation that would provide sufficient evidence in support of my claim or dispute. 

Correction. We provide the Citi Card Dispute Center with the documents which shows all the errors of the eTickets and that the eTickets were sent and received on XXXX SEVERAL DAYS LATE. Citi Card Dispute Center either failed to read the documents we provided to them or just plainly ignored the factual evidences. 

Error No. Four. Citi Card cites with XXXX XXXX and concluded that after all, I was not eligible for a refund and that I am liable for the entire {$5700.00} from inception. 

As a result of Citi Card Dispute Centers business decision that I am not eligible for a refund of the {$5700.00}, this principal amount continued to accrued finance charges and over the duration of the entire stages of investigations and collection procedures, my account has accrued unnecessarily and inappropriately finance charges in excess of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dollars. 

Citi Card Dispute Centers final adverse decision on my dispute seems to have the appearance of double standards, unfair business practice, unfair treatment. 

One standard test for small purchases from small corporate sellers like sugarmds.com and another standard for large corporate conglomerate like XXXX XXXX. 

Even after providing Citi Card Dispute Center with all the necessary documents demonstrating and presenting factual errors on the Itinerary and the eTickets, Citi Card Dispute Center ignore the evidences and cited with XXXX XXXX assertion that the travelers failed to show at checking time, among other untrue, unsupported / excuses to justify their allegations. XXXX XXXX never even have the decency to acknowledge they sent the eTickets one day late and all the mistakes on the itinerary and the eTickets which renders the eTickets useless. 

XX/XX/XXXX Filed complaint with the United States Department of Transportation Aviation Consumer Protection. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sent me email that XXXX XXXX has taken necessary action to immediately process refund in accordance to my claim / complaint. The refund was actually processed on XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX I wrote a letter to CITI Bank Customer Service Team requesting for the removal of all finance charges related to the {$5700.00}. I provided CITI Bank Customer Service Team with all the same documents to show proof of my claim/ dispute. 

XX/XX/XXXX Citi Card Dispute Center sent notice of the {$41.00} refund of the Late Fee. 

However, with clear language, CITI Bank Customer Service Team wrote that I am not eligible to a credit of the finance charges. 

CITI Bank Customer Service Team ignore my claim with all the supporting documents ; documents providing proof and justifications of my claim. This is top corporate level demonstrating further practice of double standards. 

XX/XX/XXXX - I wrote an appeal letter to the CITI Bank Customer Service Team ; an appeal to their adverse business decision. 

XX/XX/XXXX as of this date there is no response to my Appeal email letter from CITI Bank Customer Service Team. 

What I think would be a Fair Resolution I think the fairest decision and perhaps the very right thing to do is to remove the related finance charges that had accrued retroactive to inception of the purchase date of the disputed principal amount and return my account to current Status. 

1st. Had Citi Card Dispute Center rejected the initial charges of the two ( 2 ) XXXX XXXX eTickets [ ( {$2800.00} x 2 ) total {$5700.00} ] when I filed my Dispute, all of these run arounds and the accrued finance charges would not have been an issue from inception. 

I provided the Dispute Center all the documents showing the factual errors made on the eTickets that renders the eTickets useless and such charges by the XXXX XXXX should have been rejected. The eTickets retain similar if not equal condition to that of faulty product where no benefit is received and therefore the charge / purchase should be rejected. 

Instead, Citi Card Dispute Center cited with XXXX XXXX with their assertions that the travelers, among other reasons, failed to show up at checking time at XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX should have known that the travelers did in fact check-in and departed XXXX because the same travelers used XXXX XXXX XXXX to depart XXXX on time as prescheduled in accordance to the Reservation Confirmation Code No. XXXX. the only difference is that the travelers utilized different and separately purchased XXXX XXXX XXXX ; not another airline tickets. XXXX XXXX should have known the subject travelers did in fact departed as scheduled. 

What I have done to resolve the issue. 

I have utilized all possible means and provided all applicable and necessary documents at my disposal and have exhausted all levels of administrative ( internal ) means to resolve the issue relative to the finance charges that CITI Bank Corporate level Customer Service Team had adversely ruled against a credit / refund. 

Also, I have arranged with CITI Card to close my account and to retire the balance in 60 equal monthly installments, which includes the related finance charges. Taking this action does not consent full responsibility of the finance charges. If my CFPB complaint resulted in my favor, any credit amount would certainly shorten the debt service schedule. 

Closing I am forced by the circumstances to filed this complaint for further assistance. I humbly pray for your prompt intervention and successful resolution in my favor. 

The accumulated finance charges thus far are in excess of {$2500.00}. I expect CITI to be able to calculate the actual figures through their accounting records. 

If you need more information, may I suggest that we communicate via email. Due to our distance and difference in calendar day and time, the current telephone technology does not always operate in my favor.

She said my digital account didn't exist despite the account existing online and the earlier balance information being given by the automated phone assistant. The representative said she would connect me to a Digital Smart Money account. 

She ended up referring me to the same exact phone number as earlier, so I had to repeat the entire process again. The second representative gave me the same explanation, saying I did not have a Digital Checking account yet and redirected me again to the same phone number.

All due to something that I appeared to have nothing to do with, and it was your internal problem that created the entire issue. 
I believe this is fraud or a very deceptive practice from the company, crediting a client with money, refunding it to them and then reversing the process and charging them extremely high interest rates on the reversal.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,Credit card,5/23/2024,FL,"What happened? 

I am filing this complaint because my application for the American Express XXXX XXXX XXXX Credit Card was denied on XX/XX/year>. The reasons provided for the denial were based on my FICO score and specific factors related to my credit report, including the proportion of revolving balances to credit limits, length of time accounts have been established, proportion of loan balances to loan amount, and too many inquiries in the last 12 months. The denial of credit has negatively impacted my business, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I believe this decision is in violation of several federal laws, as outlined below. 

Relevant USC Codes : 1. 15 U.S. Code 1691 - Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ) - Prohibits creditors from discriminating against any applicant with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age. It ensures that all applicants are treated fairly and that decisions are made based on consistent criteria. 

XXXX. 15 U.S. Code 1691a - Definitions and rules of construction - Defines key terms and sets forth rules for interpreting the ECOA, ensuring that the rights and protections afforded to applicants are upheld. 

XXXX. 15 U.S. Code 1681b - Permissible purposes of consumer reports - Specifies the circumstances under which a consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report, including the requirement that such reports must be furnished for permissible purposes and with the consumer 's explicit consent. The use of my credit report without my explicit consent for adverse action violates this code. 

XXXX. 15 U.S. Code 1681m - Requirements on users of consumer reports- Mandates that users of consumer reports, such as American Express, must provide notice to the consumer when an adverse action is taken based on information in the report. This includes providing specific reasons for the denial and the right to obtain a free copy of the report used. 

XXXX. 15 U.S. Code 1611- Civil liability for willful noncompliance - Any person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this subchapter with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer for actual damages sustained by the consumer or statutory damages. 

XXXX. 12 U.S. Code 1431 - Powers and duties of Federal Home Loan Banks- Requires banks to provide advances to members, including small businesses, under certain conditions. This ensures that businesses have access to necessary funding. 

XXXX. 12 CFR 1002 - Regulation B - Implements the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and requires creditors to provide notice of the adverse action, including the specific reasons for the denial. This ensures transparency and allows the applicant to understand and potentially address the reasons for denial. 

XXXX. 15 U.S. Code 1602 - Definitions and rules of construction ( Truth in Lending Act - TILA ) - Provides definitions and rules for how the Act should be interpreted, including terms like "" creditor '' and "" credit sale, '' ensuring that all credit transactions are conducted fairly and transparently. 

Requested Resolution : I request the immediate review and reconsideration of my application for the American Express XXXX XXXX XXXX Credit Card. Additionally, I seek confirmation that all information used in the decision was authorized and accurate. If any unauthorized or inaccurate information was used, I request it be removed and my application be re-evaluated based on correct and authorized information.",Closed with explanation,5/23/2024

TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,Credit card,4/8/2024,NJ,"I am writing to file a formal complaint against TD Bank concerning multiple instances of mishandling, lack of communication, and unprofessional conduct. As a consumer, I have encountered numerous issues with TD Bank 's services, particularly regarding the handling of convenience checks and subsequent customer service interactions. 

On multiple occasions, TD Bank sent me convenience checks, ostensibly for use against my TD Bank credit card limit. However, my attempts to utilize these checks have been met with frustration and incompetence on the part of TD Bank. 

Specifically, on XX/XX/2024, I attempted to deposit a convenience check in the amount of {$19000.00}, out of my {$20000.00} credit limit with TD Bank. Despite promptly informing TD Bank via its message center on the same day, I received no acknowledgment or response from the bank. XXXX days later, I received notification from the financial institution where I deposited the check that it had been returned without cashing it, citing reasons unknown to me. TD Bank failed to communicate with me regarding this issue, leaving me uninformed and bewildered. 
Subsequently, on XX/XX/2024, I reached out to TD Bank once again, informing them of my intention to use another convenience check and requesting that they honor it. Despite my efforts, I received no response until I resorted to contacting TD Bank 's CEO, XXXX  XXXX, via the bank 's XXXX messaging system on XX/XX/2024. 
Then, TD Bank sent me another batches of convenience checks and emails to encourage me to use the credit limit against my credit card. 

Therefore, I attempted to deposit another convenience check sent to me by TD Bank in the amount of {$6000.00} on XX/XX/2024. Once again, the check was returned uncashed on XX/XX/2024. 

Additionally, on XX/XX/2024, I received an email notification from TD Bank informing me that my personal online banking username had been retrieved, despite my not initiating such action. Upon calling TD Bank 's customer service line, I encountered another unhelpful representative named XXXX, who failed to address my concerns and seemed disinterested in assisting me. 

I request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate these matters thoroughly and take appropriate action against TD Bank for its failure to uphold basic standards of customer service and consumer protection. Additionally, I demand reimbursement of return check fees and honor its offering of using up to {$20000.00} of my credit limit.

On this same email with said information, it also says Payment requests received by midnight Eastern time will apply to your account the same day. If my payment was indeed late, the posting date would be different but it was not. The email says XX/XX/year>. Today I was charged an unjustifiable {$30.00} late fee on my account. I reached out to Macys immediately. I requested them to remove the late fee immediately because I paid my bill on time. Macys refused. This is frustrating to have babysit this account. I love shopping at Macys but this is definitely changing my relationship with them. I have been targeted while being a loyal paying customer and always pay my bill on time or even early. I should have to go through all of this, yet here I am again due to Macys. So disappointing and not right. Please remove the unjustified {$30.00} late fee immediately and provide more than just your apology. This takes a lot of time and effort to have to contact Macys, try to get this resolved with no resolve then have to come to CFPB to file a complaint for something Macys could have fixed the first time I contacted them or not have to fix at all if the charge was not charged when the bill was paid on time.

WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,Mortgage,5/30/2024,KY,"As of today Wells Fargo still hasnt granted my loan modification after submitting all paperwork, check stubs, and bank statements. They came back and said I have no income! 

I filed a complaint in XX/XX/XXXX Complaint No. XXXX regarding Wells Fargo not allowing me to do a loan modification after they allowed me to do the loan forbearance/deferment during COVID. This is a follow up to that complaint. Original Complaint : My ex husband, XXXX and I obtained a mortgage loan with Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX. The mortgage was in XXXXXXXX XXXX name alone however I was listed on the deed. In XXXX we did a loan modification due to a financial hardship and it the listed XXXX and I both as borrowers. In XX/XX/XXXX XXXX and I separated and he moved out of the home. I continued making the payments on time. XXXX XXXX, XXXX I log into my Wells Fargo account to make my mortgage payment and something about forbearance immediately popped up. There was no wording about having to do a loan modification if I opted into the program. The information read like they would put payments at the end of the loan. I decided to do it with this understanding. I thought could payoff some other debts during that forbearance period. XX/XX/XXXX the forbearance ended and I had to start making the payments again. Then Wells Fargo called us saying we had to do a loan modification for the forbearance time period even ifwe continued to make the payment after the forbearance. I would have never opted into that program if it had said anything about a loan modification. Then we were told we were not eligible for the loan modification because XXXX no longer lived in the home. We were served with Foreclosure paperwork on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX. They will not allow me to do a loan modification by myself because they say I am not a borrower however the XXXX modification clearly list XXXX and I both as borrowers and we both signed as well and it is filed with the circuit clerks office as such on XX/XX/XXXX. The foreclosure paperwork includes interest, late fees and attorney fees as if Inever did the forbearance ( cares act stated they are not allowed to charge these fees during that time of forbearance ) Please advise. Thank you! XXXX XXXX XXXX. After this complaint they said we had to submit paperwork about filing our Quit Claim deed and I would be listed as a successor of the loan and then I could do the loan modification in two steps. The first step ( 1st modification ) being me listed as the successor of the loan then doing the financial loan modification. XXXX and I submitted all required paperwork and now they are denying the loan modification saying I have no income! Please help!",Closed with explanation,5/30/2024

Despite numerous communications with your customer service representatives and supervisors, my issue remains unresolved, and I feel that I have been repeatedly misled. 

On XX/XX/2024, I spoke to a supervisor named XXXX regarding the status of my sign-up bonus. Prior to this, I had communicated with other customer service representatives on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/2024, all of whom confirmed that I had a sign-up bonus offer on my Gold card. They assured me that I would receive the points once I hit the minimum spend of {$6000.00}. 

After meeting the required spend, I did not receive my points. Subsequently, I was told by another representative that I did not have an offer. This is particularly frustrating because I clearly remember signing up for the XXXX card due to the banner advertising the sign-up bonus. 

When I spoke to Supervisor XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, he assured me that he would follow up with the agent and that I would receive my points once I met the {$6000.00} spend. Despite meeting the spend requirement, my points were never added. 

I reached out again on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to follow up, speaking to XXXX XXXX on the latter date. XXXX assured me that the points would be added manually when my statement closed on XX/XX/XXXX. This, however, did not happen. 

Each time I reach out to customer service, the regular agents can not see the supervisor notes and provide conflicting information. I have had to repeatedly request to speak to a supervisor and explain my situation from the beginning every time. This lack of communication and consistency has caused significant inconvenience and frustration.

U.S. BANCORP,Mortgage,6/20/2022,DC,"This is a follow-up to a previous complaint that was not adequately addressed. I am requesting that the original complaint be reviewed along with the new supporting documentation indicating that I was unfairly removed from COVID-Related Relief Options. 

Original Complaint ID : XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted this letter to their consumer advocacy department as well as the XXXX XXXX XXXX  Account Number : XXXX Property Address : Department of Loss Mitigation and Consumer Advocacy : I am writing to humbly request that my account be reconsidered for a loan modification which will allow my outstanding balance accrued during the COVID-19 Forbearance to be placed into the my loan and allow me to resume previously established monthly payments. This request is based on the fact that I, in good faith, enrolled in the COVID-19 forbearance plan and followed the rules and guidance as provided from US Bank representatives . Despite these efforts, and as a result of incorrect guidance from the US Bank agents, my COVID-19 forbearance participation period was erroneously extended one month beyond the allowed time limit. The culpable missteps were confirmed by an investigation by US Bank as reported by US Bank Customer Advocacy -- XXXX XXXX ( quotes denoted in blue below ) : As no further suspension of payments was available, you contacted us on XX/XX/XXXX, for review of modifications. You were removed from the COVID-19 forbearance plan that day, and placed into deferment modification in XX/XX/XXXX. Final documents requiring your signature for approval were sent in letters dated XX/XX/XXXX, and again on XX/XX/XXXX, for follow up, which were not returned. 

It was my belief based on this conversation that I was still enrolled in the COVID-19 forbearance plan at the conclusion of this call.

Clarification should have been provided to you regarding your request to extend the deferment, as there is no extension of the deferment, and your COVID-19 forbearance extension was removed when reviewed for the deferment. 

Therefore, by your own admission, clarification of this unique program was not provided, thus it was reasonable to have the understanding that I was still enrolled in the COVID-19 forbearance plan. 



Additionally, we found that the proper internal task was not opened with your request to remove the deferment on XX/XX/XXXX, causing your review not to close until XXXX due to failure to return the modification documents. Furthermore, on a call completed with you in XXXX, due to you stating you were still on the COVID-19 forbearance until XXXX, the agent failed to communicate that your forbearance had ended in XXXX in oversight of your account ; therefore, you were inaccurately told to contact us back in XXXX instead of reviewing options at that time. 

Given the specific misinformation provided above, it is reasonable for one to conclude that I was still protected under the COVID-19 forbearance plan. 



When your review was closed in XXXX, you were due XXXX payments, which put you over the allotted 18- month payment delinquency The delayed review, per above admission directly led to the one month overage of the allotted 18 month limit. 



therefore, you were ineligible for post-forbearance options. When you contacted us in XXXX, we explained that post-forbearance options were not available unless you were to pay down your delinquency, or you would be placed for a traditional retention review, where a Mortgage Assistance Application ( MAA ) is required for review. Furthermore, in XXXX, we found that communication regarding timeframe for review of options was given in receipt of additional documentation requested was accurately completed. 

The enclosed Customer assistance summary information letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, was sent to you showing completion of our underwriting departments review, providing a conditional approval for a short sale. 

Our records reflect, due to an internal system issue, you were wrongfully denied the option for a repayment plan and offered the conditionally approved Short Sale ; The offer of a Short Sale was an untenable option. An option that did not reflect the weight of the conflicting guidance previously provided. 



therefore, after review of your financials provided, we reverted your plan back for approval of the repayment plan. This repayment plan offer is enclosed for your reference and show that funds were received on XX/XX/XXXX for acceptance of this plan. 

The payment made was to reflect my good faith efforts and demonstrate my dedication to maintain home ownership. My submission of payment should not connote repayment plan acceptance as the payment as outlined is not sustainable. 



I respectfully request to remit the amount necessary to bring my loan current from the period which my COVID-19 forbearance expired ( XXXX ). After which time, I request resumption of all options afforded under the COVID-19 forbearance plan.",Closed with non-monetary relief,6/20/2022
NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION,Checking or savings account,7/9/2024,TX,"A deposit was made to an account that I have with Navy Federal Credit Union.

On the second call I was told that the sending bank ( the bank the check was written on gave indication that the check may be fraudulent. However, after checking the other bank account on the same day, I found that the check had already been processed and cashed. So on the second call I asked for a supervisor who then told me that it would be 5 business days and that it would be available on XX/XX/year>. I verified by repeating the information and getting the supervisor 's name which was XXXX. So I said okay and ended the call. On XX/XX/year> I checked for the funds and they were still not there? Once again I called on XX/XX/year> and spoke with a representative who then told me that the hold would be another day. She was sorry that they miscalculated the time frame. So I asked for a supervisor again. XXXX another supervisor proceeded to tell me that the review process is done through their system and they can not remove the hold. I said so you are telling me you can not remove a hold and that there is no one that can? He said yes it just has to fall off. So I asked why then did the time frame change from 2 business days to 5 business days for the hold? He did not answer that question. I told him well the funds have been received so you guys should release the hold. I said I can provide information to show the check was cashed, but he said they still could not remove the hold. He stated he was sorry they gave me wrong information. I said so you are saying you guys can not remove the hold and you can not see when funds have been processed by the Fed Reserve for deposits made to accounts? He said no we can not. I asked well how do you know if a check is good or not or if funds are deposited from a sending bank? He said oh, they just place the hold and then it just falls off at the set time ( up to 5 business days ). So, I called again and got a supervisor named XXXX who stated that everyone was correct in what they told me. I asked for the process when a check was deposited and a hold was placed. They told me it could be up to 5 business days. I asked well why was I told 2 business days then it changed to 5? He did not answer. I asked who could I speak with to have the hold released? He said there was no one. Then. he proceeded to tell me that this was for my protection. I said well you have the funds from the sending back so the hold should be released. He then said that they have to just wait for the hold to fall off because the sending bank could come back and say there was fraud on the account. I said well they would not because the funds were there and they have sent them to you. He then proceeded to reiterate that this was for my protection because the other bank could come back and say there was fraud. I told him this was a check from my husband from an account that had the same address as mine and same last name as mine and that my husband was not going to come back and say there was fraud. He proceeded to tell me that the bank could do it without the account holder doing anything. I said so even if my husband said nothing the bank could come back and say there was fraud? He said yes the bank could say there was fraud and ask for the funds back. I was shocked and amazed. This bank/credit union needs to be investigated/reviewed. They are obviously doing some very shady business. Considering all the negative media they have received I would guess that there are other things gong on there as well. I still have not received my funds and they have stated I just have to wait for the hold to fall off, I can not even go into a branch. The last supervisor even debated with me about them making money to benefit the business itself. Telling me they are not profiting from this. At which point I told him that they are because they are a business and a business needs money to run. Without it they would be in business.",Closed with explanation,7/9/2024
AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,Credit card,5/16/2024,NV,"Dear Sir/Madam, On XXXX XX/XX/year>, I have applied the XXXX XXXX American Express XXXX XXXX XXXX American Express XXXX In the application page, it is advised that I can receive XXXX XXXX points as the welcome bonus, after I spend XXXX USD within the first XXXX months of card membership. In my application process, there is no warning informing me that I was not eligible to receive the advertised welcome bonus. Normally, if a new card member is not eligible, there will be a pop-up message. My application quickly got approved and the new account was established on the same date. After I receive my card, I used it for daily purchases. 

On the evening of XXXX XX/XX/year>, I contacted American Express customer service through their XXXXXXXX XXXX chat function, to check if my spending has already met the requirement for welcome bonus. However, I was informed by the customer service representative, XXXX, that there is no welcome bonus with my account. Her original words are "" The welcome offer has been denied for this card on your account, it was cancelled after the card application ''. I requested to talk to the supervisor. However, the supervisor said that there was a warning informing me that I am not eligible for welcome bonus, but I missed it. The statement made by the supervisor is completed contradicting to the statement made by the customer service representative. 

The customer service representative admitted that "" the welcome bonus is cancelled ( by AMEX ) after card application ''. I regard this as a serious business misconduct and cheating of credit customer to apply for a credit card. The advertised and promised welcome benefits was cancelled unilaterally by American Express, after the card is approved, and the annual fee is paid. This is a unilateral violation of contract, as well as a misleading and fraudulent advertisement. The promised terms in the public advertisement is never fulfilled. 

Therefore, I demand American Express to immediately reinstate the welcome bonus in my account ( XXXX XXXX points upon XXXX USD eligible spending ), or reimburse me with appropriate cash with equivalent value. American Express should be demanded to review its internal policies. Cancelling a promised welcome term, after the credit card is accepted, and annual fee is paid without even notifying the customer should be strictly prohibited. 

All the evidence, including XXXX XXXX  messaging records with American Express customer service are kept. I am happy to provide any other information to assist your investigation. 

Thank you for your time in reviewing my compliant against American Express. Please accept my hearty gratitude for your hard work in making quality consumer financial services fairly delivered to all Americans.

Seeking clarity, I contacted Chase customer support, who advised me to pay off any new transactions as soon as they were posted to my account to avoid interest charges. Trusting this guidance, I promptly settled any outstanding balances, excluding the transferred amount. 

In the subsequent billing cycle, I made approximately {$1800.00} in purchases, adhering to the representative 's instructions by paying them off immediately upon posting. However, to my surprise, I incurred a {$30.00} interest charge on my XXXX statement closure. Upon querying this discrepancy, I was informed by Chase that payments could only be made after statement generation, contradicting their prior advice. 

Acknowledging my initial oversight of the balance transfer terms, I settled the {$30.00} interest charge. Nevertheless, I anticipated exemption from interest on subsequent transactions, given my commitment to prompt payment. Despite my efforts, a {$20.00} interest charge appeared on my XXXX statement, prompting another unsuccessful appeal to Chase for waiver, even after escalation to a supervisor named XXXX, whose response was unhelpful and discourteous. 

Consequently, I've paid {$30.00} in interest charges and an additional {$1800.00} towards the balance transfer amount, alongside a {$270.00} balance transfer fee. As a longstanding Chase Sapphire Reserve customer with a history of full balance payment, I find myself in this predicament due to convoluted terms and misinformation from Chase representatives. 

I believe in fairness and accountability, thus initially assuming responsibility for the interest charges. However, I find it unjust to bear the burden of subsequent charges, as they stem from erroneous guidance provided by Chase.

After Citibank closed the account, they did not return or apply that deposit to my balance. Instead, the balance has ballooned to over {$3500.00}, on a {$1000.00} credit limit. Due to excessive late fees, returned payment charges, and interest that continued even after closure. 

Ive contacted them multiple times to dispute these charges and requested they assess or remove the fees, but nothing has been corrected. Ive reached out numerous times on a conflict of returned payment fees, interest fees, among others as I left a financially abusive relationship which entailed correcting other accounts where my payments where at one point paid from. At one point, I calculated that nearly {$1000.00} in fees had accumulated. Adding to the problem, I can no longer access my account through the Citi app or website, making it impossible for me to view statements, track charges, or properly dispute anything.

This lack of transparency and customer service is severely impacting my credit as I continue to work hard to repair it. Im requesting that Citibank be required to refund or apply my deposit, reverse excessive charges, and correct the inaccurate reporting.

It is unreasonable and likely unlawful for Citibank to continue charging interest and late fees on a secured account that they themselves closed. Once an account is closed, especially by the creditor, the terms of active borrowing and continued interest accrual should not persist, particularly when I no longer had access to the account to make payments or manage charges.

They claimed the reason was because I still owed XXXX dollars but they couldn't tell what the charge was for. I have spoken to Synchrony several times this year and was always met with hostility from their Customer Service Reps. 

As a result I had to close the XXXX accounts I had with them to ensure they couldn't continue charging me in a fraudulent manner. However that wasn't the case. I had a XXXX credit limit with Lowes and Synchrony they reduced the credit limit down to what I owed, which made it look like I had used XXXX XXXX of my limit.

But, on XX/XX/XXXX I received a check dated XX/XX/XXXX for {$600.00}. I called Citibank. What should I do? Should I deposit the check or should wait for the new one? In my opinion the lady answering the phone had no clue as XXXX had very difficult time explaining what happened. Obviously not at a standard that I would have expected from someone that works fir a prestigious institution as Citibank. She said ser dont worry go haed and deposit the check. The check is good. Are you sure I asked? Yes, Yes she replied. What is your name? she said my name is XXXX

I immediately called Citibank, again after a long explanation the lady tells me that they stopped payment on the check on XX/XX/XXXX. 

It is embarrassing for me with my bank that a check gets returned unpaid. It is very like that the bank will assess the usual return item fees. It is possible that the bank could affect my relationship with that bank negatively After my conversation on XX/XX/XXXX I really don't know where I stand? Am I receiving {$600.00}? would the check be good? would they apply to my balance? Am I receiving a second check from the second conversation and what to do with it? although, currently my balance is XXXX but I anticipate a charge of {$610.00}. I would be afraid to make any other calls that seem to make this matter even more complex.

After switching phone carriers, I was unable to select my phone number as valid method to receive a one-time code to authenticate my online account. It was on my third call to Chase and escalating the conversation to where I was connected with a technical representative who was able to solve the issue within minutes. I was informed that the root cause of my issue was because I switched mobile phone carriers and the original authentication message was sent to the old phone provider and returned back as a bad phone number. Because of this my phone number was put on a blacklist and was not able to be used until they removed it from it and reconfigured it. 

I had contacted Chase Bank about this issue three separate times. The complaint is in regard to the frontline customer service troubleshooting procedure. On all three calls when speaking to the first associate who answered the phone, I was informed to disable my Dual Factor Authentication as a method of resolution. 

The main concern I have is in regard to Chase 's policy and procedure to inform consumers to remove the Dual Factor Authentication as a method of resolution as a first line of problem solving when they clearly have other resources to help solve their issue. The solution to remove the Dual Factor Authentication as a process/procedure creates online account take over vulnerability for all consumers who follow that direction.",Closed with explanation,3/29/2024

The text stated that they needed more information about my Chase checking account and to continue using the account, I had to call them, or my account would be closed soon.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,Mortgage,5/2/2024,NY,"XX/XX/XXXX Re : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Complaint XXXX Subject : Response to Chase 's Claim of First Lien Position Threat Whereas, Governor XXXX vetoed XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. She let stand an executive order prohibiting lien sales for water and sewer charges. In addition, Senate Bill 2023-S2540 is introduced to extend the Executive Order prohibiting lien sales for water and swerve charges. In accordance with these measures, the city council has decided not to renew the law authorizing lien sales for water and sewer charges. Chase Bank can not claim a threat to their first lien position which has been nullified by the mechanism of the legislative and executive apparatus of government.

Moreover, my longstanding agreement with the Department of Environmental Protection ( DEP ) explicitly safeguards Chase Bank 's first lien position. This agreement was established to ensure the bank 's security interest in my property. Despite the clear legal landscape delineated by executive order, legislative initiatives, and my contractual agreement with DEP, Chase Bank has embarked on a campaign of predatory manipulation. Their aim is transparent : to enable foreclosure proceedings under the guise of protecting their first lien position.

Argumentation : Disregard for Legal Prohibitions : Chase Bank 's attempt to foreclose on my property disregards the executive order prohibiting the recording of liens and lien sales for water and sewer charges. This demonstrates a blatant disregard for the legal framework established by the state government to safeguard homeowners.

Manipulative Practices : By asserting the protection of their first lien position as justification for foreclosure proceedings, Chase Bank attempts to mask their predatory lending practices. The executive order, coupled with the expiration of laws authorizing lien sales, nullifies any legitimate claim by the bank to prioritize their position. 
Violation of Contractual Agreement : Furthermore, Chase Bank 's actions directly violate the longstanding agreement between myself and the DEP, which explicitly protects the bank 's first lien position. Their disregard for this agreement underscores their predatory intent and lack of respect for contractual obligations.

Conclusion : In conclusion, Chase Bank 's predatory and manipulative practices represent a grave threat to homeowners ' rights and financial security. Their attempt to foreclose on my property in defiance of existing legal prohibitions and contractual agreements must be swiftly addressed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I implore the bureau to investigate this matter thoroughly and take decisive action to hold Chase Bank accountable for their reprehensible conduct.

This ongoing issue stems from a series of unresolved problems including unauthorized transactions, ineffective customer communication, and failure to manage my account properly.Account Mismanagement and Unauthorized Transactions : Starting in XX/XX/year>, I discovered unauthorized changes and transactions in my account. Despite multiple immediate notifications to Chime, these issues were met with generic responses and a lack of meaningful action. The failure to swiftly and accurately address these unauthorized transactions allowed further vulnerabilities in my account, which led to substantial financial losses.Ineffective Communication and Customer Support : Throughout my ordeal, Chime has consistently used canned responses that fail to address specific issues I raised, notably during critical times when immediate action was needed. For example, in XX/XX/year>, after I reported suspicious activity, the response I received failed to acknowledge the severity of the situation, further delaying resolution and exacerbating the financial impact.Unresolved Disputes and Delay Tactics : Significant financial disputes arose following the initial unauthorized transactions. My repeated attempts to resolve these disputes were met with continued delays. It appears that Chimes strategy includes stalling the resolution process, possibly to let the statute of limitations expire, thereby avoiding accountability. This delay has prevented the resolution of critical financial disputes and the return of stolen funds.Impact on Business Operations : The direct consequences of Chime 's actions on my business have been severe. Due to the unresolved account status and inaccessible funds, I have been unable to fulfill several business obligations, resulting in operational disruptions and financial losses. This situation was particularly detrimental in XX/XX/year>, when I failed to complete a significant business transaction due to the inaccessibility of my funds.Reprinting of Expired Checks and Mishandling of Funds : A critical issue arose with the mishandling of a {$10000.00} check, which needed reprinting after expiring due to Chime 's delayed responses. Furthermore, I am awaiting a closure check for my credit builder account, which has also not been issued. This delay and negligence further underscores the financial mismanagement by Chime.Arrest of Identity Thief and Ongoing Security Issues : The identity theft issue culminated in the arrest of the perpetrator in Texas, who had cashed a fraudulently obtained check.

I filed a complaint earlier in the year with this agency, it was passed along to Citibank, they reviewed it and immediately denied the request to restore my credit limit. They are actively harming my credit score by repeatedly lowering my limit to make it appear I am using more credit - its been cut in half over the several years Ive had the card, despite no late payments.

Despite confirmation from my employer regarding the issuance of the funds, the deposit has yet to be credited to my account.Repeated Attempts for Resolution : Following my initial contact, I have made multiple attempts to resolve this matter through both phone support and email communications with Chime. Each time, I was assured of an escalation and follow-up, which has not occurred. It's now been over 90 days since the deposit was expected, and there has been no resolution or substantive response from Chime.Change in Direct Deposit Arrangement : Due to Chime 's repeated delays in crediting my account with my paycheckoften taking over two weeks despite their slogan promising pay up to two days earlyI made the decision to discontinue directing my paycheck deposits to Chime. This decision was made in response to the ongoing and unacceptable delays that have caused me undue financial hardship causing me to pay bills late and causing me late fees when thinking my paycheck was available in my bank account.Specific Concerns : It is my belief that Chime 's actionsor lack thereofconstitute a fraudulent withholding of my funds. Since discontinuing my direct deposits to Chime, there has been a complete cessation of deposit activity from my employer 's payments, further compounding my financial difficulties and leading me to question the integrity of Chime 's operations.The lack of response, resolution, and the substantial impact of Chime 's actions on my financial wellbeing have compelled me to seek the assistance of the CFPB.

When I contacted the bank, I learned that my PIN and email had been changed without my knowledgemy account was compromised. I reported it immediately and was told my account was blocked until I visited a branch. 

At the branch, rather than feeling supported in resolving this fraud, I felt dismissed and treated with suspicion. I was told to change my account number, which created issues for payroll and deposits. I was also required to pay off my overdraft reserve and reapplydespite being the victim of fraud. 

Throughout multiple interactions, I was met with skepticism and unjustified restrictions. When requesting a cash advance from my Platinum Card ( $ XXXX limit ), I was repeatedly denied despite confirming my account status. Ultimately, the bank canceled my card and labeled me a "" high risk '' customer, even though I had never missed a payment or engaged in suspicious activity. It felt like I was being blamed for the fraud committed against me.

ng mismanagement of my escrow account and failure to properly handle insurance-related matters. These issues have occurred repeatedly, causing significant stress and financial burden.

1. Forced Insurance Policy : Initially, Mr. Cooper claimed they did not receive proper notice that the property was covered under an insurance policy, despite evidence that this information was provided to both Nationstar and the broker, Better Mortgage. As a result, they purchased a high-risk forced insurance policy. This was later refunded when my insurance provider had to speak with them multiple times. Mr. Cooper admitted to making a mistake and rectified the issue. 

2. Failure to Make Escrow Payments : Subsequently, Mr. Cooper failed to make escrow payments to my insurance provider, nearly causing me to lose my insurance policy. I was forced to make a cash payment to the insurance company to keep my policy in good standing. Again, Mr. Cooper apologized and claimed there was an issue executing the escrow payment. My insurance company confirmed that a new/different payment was later received.

3. Inconsistent Escrow Amounts : Most recently, these issues have resurfaced with Mr. Cooper changing my escrow amount. The escrow amount continues to vary wildly each month without proper explanation. This inconsistency is not experienced with other lenders.

4. Lack of Resolution : When I confronted Mr. Cooper 's support team about these ongoing issues, they ended the chat without providing any solution or explanation. 

These repeated failures in managing my escrow account and insurance payments have caused undue stress, potential lapses in insurance coverage, and financial hardship. I am seeking a thorough investigation into these practices, a clear explanation of the escrow calculation methods, and assurance that my escrow account will be properly managed moving forward. 

I request that the CFPB investigate these issues and take appropriate action to ensure that Nationstar Mortgage LLC ( Mr. Cooper ) improves its practices to prevent such problems from occurring to other homeowners.",Closed with explanation,8/16/2024

Both cards earned XXXX points, which were combined into a single XXXX account. It is my understanding that these points should not expire as long as at least XXXX card remains active. Earlier this year, I decided to close my Citi XXXX account. During the account closure process, the Citibank representative did not mention that this would result in the forfeiture of my XXXX points. Additionally, I received no email, mail, or text notification alerting me of this critical detail. Today, more than {$4000.00} ( XXXX points ) had vanished without warning. Upon contacting Citibank customer service, I was informed that the points were forfeited due to the account closure. However, this forfeiture was not communicated to me during the closure process or at any point prior to the expiration of the points. I find it unacceptable for a bank of XXXX stature to omit such important information and fail to notify customers about impending forfeitures. The lack of communication is both unethical and unprofessional. The forfeited points are not a trivial amount ; they represent significant value, XXXX than {$4000.00}. I believe Citibank has failed to uphold its responsibility to provide clear and timely information to its customers, especially regarding critical account changes and potential forfeitures.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,Credit card,5/13/2024,CA,"Last summer, I followed a professional baseball team around the country to watch their games in many cities. I purchased all of my tickets ahead of time through XXXX so that I was guaranteed quality tickets. Once I procured tickets, I then purchased flight tickets and hotel reservations. 

I purchased tickets through XXXX for XXXX events that took place within about a XXXX day period. That allowed me to book all of my travel arrangements. 

The first XXXX events that I went to with those XXXX tickets granted me access to the venue but were in far inferior seats than what XXXX advertised and sold to me. I paid premium prices for premium tickets but then was provided far inferior seats. When I called XXXX from the event I was at, they said they would take care of it. When I followed up the next day, I was told it would go through their process but it would be taken care of. XXXX days later, I went to the second event with XXXX tickets that were not what I was sold. 

XXXX told me that the tickets are sold from other consumers and they are just the middle-man. However, XXXX also has a guarantee that if the tickets are not as described, they will either refund the money or provide better seats. XXXX did neither. At that point, I couldn't continue spending XXXX of dollars for travel and not know of the quality of seats, if any, that I would have. So I had to purchase tickets for those events elsewhere even though I had XXXX more events of XXXX tickets. 

XXXX told me that I should post my future tickets up for sales on their website ( which they make money off of ) in hopes of getting my money back since I didn't want to continue taking the risk of their tickets being inaccurate. I explained that if they didn't sell or sold for less than what I paid, I would be getting ripped off again, and it wasn't fair to me. 

After numerous calls/emails, I was offered XXXX XXXX reduction on my most recent transaction. Obviously, that wasn't fair to me. After speaking to supervisors and sending in paperwork, I was offered a {$500.00} future credit for the website and reversing my most recent change ( {$760.00} ). The {$760.00} was reversed, but I refused both the XXXX XXXX reduction and {$500.00} future credit since my charges were for over {$500.00}. 

XXXX supervisors from XXXX eventually said that I needed to have my credit card company file disputes for the transactions. The supervisors, who claimed they were the highest level of support that a consumer could talk to, had their hands tied. They were only able to do what was already offered ( XXXX XXXX reduction, reversal of most recent charge ), and if that wasn't fair to me, I would have to file disputes with my credit card company. 

When I first tried to file disputes with my credit card company, as the merchant requested, the credit card company ( Chase ) refused to open the claims. They said that since I accessed the event, nothing was owed. I explained that the only way I knew that my tickets were not what was sold to me was by accessing the event. They said it didn't matter. Now, when I have followed up with Chase about this, the supervisor used a different excuse as to why they won't open a dispute ( even though the merchant insisted that is what I needed to do ), telling me this time that it was too long after the transaction, so I would have to provide information directly from the merchant. That isn't my fault that they failed to adhere to their responsibilities originally and aren't holding the merchant to their guarantee of refunding the tickets or providing better tickets if the ones provided aren't what were advertised.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,Credit card,3/5/2024,NY,"JPMCB CARD SERVICES is in violation of the several CARD Act policies, and I would like to have this alleged account reviewed, modified or removed from my personal private consumer report. 
The following CARD Act violations apply : No interest rate increases for the first year. 
Credit card issuers generally can not raise interest rates, or any fees, during the first year an account is open, except when a variable rate changes, a promotional rate ends or a required minimum payment is more than 60 days late. 

Limits on fees and penalties. 
Over-limit fees. Cardholders can not be charged over-limit fees unless they give express permission ( opt in ) to the card issuer to approve transactions that exceed their credit limits. If permission is not given, transactions that exceed the credit limit most likely will be turned down. Without opt in card companies cant charge over-limit fees. I never gave express permission or opted in with JPMCB Card Services, but I was charged excessive fees. 

Double cycle billing. 
Although this act is prohibited, JPMCB Card Services included the previous billing period when calculating the amount of interest charged in the current billing cycle. 

Billing Statements. 
Delivery of statements. Credit card companies must mail ( or deliver electronically ) credit card bills at least 21 days before payment is due. If there is a grace period, the grace period must extend for at least a 21-day period from when the statement is mailed.

Also, Minimum payment warning. If you carry a balance, card companies must print on your billing statement the time and total interest it would take to pay off your current card balance if you only make minimum monthly payments. The bill must also disclose the monthly payment required to pay off the card balance in three years ( 36 months ). This is called the minimum payment warning, and it is designed to show cardholders how they can get out of debt more quickly by paying more than the minimum. The disclosure also must include a toll free number for credit counseling and debt management services. I was never afforded these requirements.

Finally, 15 USC 1666b ( a ) - Timing of payments.

A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date.",Closed with explanation,3/5/2024

WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,Mortgage,3/31/2024,CA,"After submitting complaint XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX at Wells Fargo informed me via email on XX/XX/XXXX that he would not be able to respond to me about their investigation XX/XX/XXXX. The investigation is related to several recorded conversations when Wells Fargo provided me erroneous information about their forbearance program, which resulted in destroying my credit. The investigation will determine whether or not I need to pay them $ XXXX of payments that were on pause while participating in their forbearance program. 

According to Wells Fargo, I need to pay them $ XXXX of forbearance delayed payments by XX/XX/XXXX. If I do not, they will require me to pay the full amount of my property loan and could push me into foreclosure. 

This provides me with only 7 days from when their investigation is complete about whether I owe them $ XXXX or not until when the $ XXXX would be due. I have called Wells Fargo to request they accelerate their investigation or postpone the XX/XX/XXXX deadline. They said they could not do either. 

While I believe the investigation will be found in my favor, it is not possible to move a large of funds from one account to another in that short of time. This ridiculously short timeline that Wells Fargo has created is putting me into an impossible financial situation. Furthermore, it is positioning me for additional credit damage, and is putting my family 's only home at risk. I made on time payments for my entire 25 year credit history, and did not have one negative mark until Wells Fargo did this to me. This is another predatory example of their program, and it is unethical.

I did receive the paperwork which I promptly returned. But 30 days later -- the legal limit -- I had not received any reply. I contacted them and they said that they had not received my application, but they agreed to send me a new application so that I could try again.

The billing amount for which I sought a refund was {$750.00}. 

For reference, the contract established with XXXX, was for digital marketing for my independent small business. The total billable amount was for {$1500.00}, of which I paid {$750.00} using my Capital One credit card. The merchant did not provide the agreed upon service.

I have gone back-and-forth for the last few months with Capital One. I have provided details on the situation, but fear there is a lack of understanding on the intricacies of how the merchant in question failed to render the services that were agreed upon. That said, it is clear that XXXX blocked the ads and I did not receive the services for which I paid. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Capital One sent me a letter that the dispute has been closed, citing "" a limited amount of time to reverse a charge on ( a ) customer 's account ( s ) ''. This is not valid for this dispute. Again, the transaction in question was billed on XX/XX/XXXX, and I notified Capital One of the dispute on XX/XX/XXXX.

That card issuer, XXXX, was provided with the same details I have shared with you and already resolved the matter by issuing me a full refund. This leads me to believe that Capital One is not acting in good faith to resolve the {$750.00} dispute I have brought forward.

Wells Fargo then gave me a payoff for my full mortgage of {$86000.00}. They are unable to give me a payoff for the {$5000.00} because when I refinanced my home a couple of years ago in XXXX, we refinanced {$92000.00} and rolled the {$5000.00} ( which I was told was closing costs and taxes on my mortgage ) into the mortgage so that we were then paying off {$98000.00}.

At this point it appears that Wells Fargo rolled the {$5000.00} into my mortgage and at the same time filed a mortgage GAP lien on my title for {$5000.00}.

Synchrony Financial 's strict interpretation of the two returned checks in the past twelve months is at best unmindful of facts or extenuating circumstances. The two checks that were rejected by my Bank 's ( XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) XXXX, although technically falling in the twelve months period, actually occurred in a two day period ( XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX, XXXX  ). 

The occurrences on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX are explained by the attached letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX, Senior Executive Vice President/General Counsel of XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX ) ( attached ). I had no idea why XXXX rejected the XX/XX/year> payments since I had been using their XXXX, with the same account number, since XXXX merged with XXXX XXXX Bank. 

Once the administrative error was recognized, a payment of {$230.00} ( {$140.00} + {$83.00} ) was made on XX/XX/year>, with the corrected account number. Synchrony 's customer service representative acknowledged the payment and the error ; and credited the interest/late fee charged. Problem solved, or so I thought. 

Four months later, after the issue was cured and resolved, without prior notice and despite regular payments starting with the {$230.00} payment on XX/XX/year>, Synchrony Financial arbitrarily closed my Amazon account and reduced my credit limit on my Sams Club account to a meager {$250.00} from {$10000.00}. 

I have had the Amazon and Sams Club accounts for well over 20 years without issues. The only reason I am persistent in restoring these accounts is because we like to shop at Amazon and Sams Club. 

I suspect the negative information in the XXXX credit file was the result of Synchrony 's actions. Because, I know nothing else changed. Synchrony set it up and then cited it to justify its actions. 

The fact is that my wife and I have a combined credit card limit of over {$100000.00} on three other credit cards NOT serviced by Synchrony Financial.",Closed with explanation,7/3/2024

"Bread Financial Holdings, Inc.",Credit card,5/5/2024,NC,"I am writing to lodge a complaint against KAYS Jewelers regarding a {$440.00} interest charge imposed on an account belonging to my husband, and myself. The account was fully paid off and was recently under a promotional plan from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. This plan offered a 12-month interest-free period, during which we made monthly payments of {$74.00} toward our {$2700.00} balance. The promotional period ended on XX/XX/XXXX, after which we expected any interest charges to commence if the balance remained unpaid. 
Before obtaining the card, a representative at the XXXX XXXX branch in XXXX, NC assured us that interest charges would only apply after the 12-month promotional period if the balance remained outstanding. Consequently, we believed that interest for the first year would be waived entirely and would only begin accruing thereafter if the balance wasn't cleared within 12 months. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, we discovered a significant interest charge posted to our account on XX/XX/XXXX. To our dismay, we were informed that we owed a year 's worth of interest for the uncleared balance that remained on the account after the 12-month promotional period. This information was not disclosed to us during the card application process, leading us to continue making minimum payments into the 13th month. Had we been aware that a lump sum of 12-month accrued interest would be imposed instead of monthly interest starting onward from the 13th month, we would have paid off the balance much sooner. Following a discussion with a representative, we promptly paid the entire balance of {$1400.00}. The representative assured us that they would request the branch to acknowledge the payment and remove the interest charges. However, despite expectations of receiving email confirmation regarding the status of this request, we have not been contacted.",Closed with explanation,5/13/2024

Upon exiting the facility on XX/XX/year>, my XXXX XXXX XXXX was charged for the entire stay and my prepaid credit was not applied.

I attempted to contact the vendor to resolve this but did not get a response. Therefore I opened a dispute with Capital One on XX/XX/XXXX to reverse the prepaid parking charge since my entire stay was paid for by other means ( i.e. the XXXX XXXX ). 

Capital One did not reach out to the merchant to investigate but instead closed the inquiry saying it "" lacks the requested information ''.

Capital One 's position is absurd and anti-consumer : XXXX ) Consumers can not control the amount of detail that a vendor provides on a receipt. Capital One 's policy perversely rewards merchants who provide the least information.

XXXX ) Consumers open credit card disputes because a merchant is unhelpful or uncooperative. The entire point of a credit card dispute is to ask the credit card issuer to investigate the claim and demand a justification from an unresponsive merchant. Shifting the burden to the consumer renders the entire dispute process useless. 

In summary, my dispute was based on a claim of "" Paid by Other Means '' and I provided sufficient documentation to substantiate my claim.

"CITIBANK, N.A.",Credit card,5/9/2024,OH,"Citi is not applying my payments to my highest interest rate balance, resulting in an unending cycle of illegal interest charges. 
I opened a Citi Double Cash card to take advantage of a no interest balance transfer offer on XX/XX/2024. Between then and XX/XX/XXXX, I made {$4800.00} in purchases. 
Throughout that time period, I made 17 payments totaling {$5000.00}. This includes three minimum payments, which under Citi 's terms includes the total amount of interest due each cycle as well as portions that will be applied to the balance transfer and standard purchase balance. The minimum payments for this period totaled {$390.00}. 
As such, at least {$4600.00} should have been used to pay down the standard purchase balance, which has an interest rate of 23.24 percent. It should not have been used to pay down the balance transfer. 
The balance transfer of {$10000.00} was made XX/XX/XXXX and came with a {$300.00} fee on XX/XX/XXXX. 
For the statement ending XX/XX/XXXX, Citi reports that the remaining balance transfer balance is {$7900.00} and the remaining standard purchase balance is {$2700.00}. This makes it abundantly clear that the payments are not going to the highest interest rate balance. As such, interest charges will continue indefinitely. 
I called Citi on XX/XX/XXXX to have the situation addressed. I was on the phone for 90 minutes. Citi insisted that the payments were going to the standard purchases when it was clear that they were not. 
I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and was on the phone for almost the entirety of the period from XXXX XXXX. until XXXX XXXX. I was redirected to four different numbers. I was told they would transfer my payments to my standard purchases. I asked if they would send me an email confirming that they would do this and they told me I would receive an email in 24-48 hours. No email arrived. 
Subsequently, I received a letter in the mail dated XX/XX/XXXX that repeated my card 's terms concerning the application of payments, which if followed would be legal, and then said this was the reason they could not apply my payment as requested, which is illegal per the CARD Act. 
Finally, today on XX/XX/XXXX, I called to see if they would confirm how much I have made in purchases and how much I have made in payments since the card was opened. The customer service person said they could not do this. But, he confirmed that my current purchases balance is {$2400.00}.",Closed with explanation,5/9/2024

U.S. BANCORP,Credit card,6/3/2025,NY,"I am filing a formal complaint regarding significant and unacceptable issues with my recently approved U.S. Bank XXXX XXXX account. Despite my account being approved and my security deposit being held by U.S. Bank for multiple weeks, I have been unable to use the card due to ongoing activation problems, compounded by repeated misinformation and a severe lack of follow-through from U.S. Bank XXXX customer service representatives. This situation has resulted in my funds being held without access to the promised XXXX  card service, causing considerable frustration and inconvenience. 
Timeline of Events and Misinformation : * Card Receipt and Initial Activation Issue : Upon receiving and attempting to activate my U.S. Bank XXXX  Card, I discovered I could not use it. 
* Initial Contact - XX/XX/year> : I contacted U.S. Bank customer support ( specifically calling XXXX and XXXX, with multiple calls logged ). I was informed by an agent that a XXXX would call me back within XXXX hours to resolve the activation issue. No XXXX call was received within the promised timeframe. 
* XXXX XXXX - XX/XX/year> : After the initial XXXX period elapsed with no callback, I contacted U.S. Bank XXXX XXXX via XXXX, with multiple calls logged, including a XXXX call ). I spoke with "" XXXX in XXXX XXXX Services. '' I was once more told that I would have to wait another XXXX hours for a supposed call from a XXXX. Again, no call was received. 
* XXXX XXXX - XX/XX/year> ( later in the day ) : After another XXXX period passed with no resolution or callback, I called U.S. Bank for XXXX final time. During this call, I spoke with "" XXXX at XXXX XXXX, XXXX with XXXX XXXX. '' I was finally informed that I would need to fax certain documents to U.S. Bank ; otherwise, my account, which was already accepted and funded with my security deposit ( held since XX/XX/year> ), would be closed. 
* Faxing of Documents and Current Status : On XX/XX/year>, I promptly faxed the requested documents as instructed. I have since been informed that it will take XXXX business days for these documents to be reviewed. Furthermore, I was told that this review might still result in the XXXX  of my account. If the account is XXXX XXXX which it appears it might already have been, given the lack of functionality ), I was advised that it could take an unacceptable XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX and a half billing cycles ) to receive my security deposit back. 
Summary of XXXX : * Repeated Misinformation : I was consistently given inaccurate information regarding XXXX callbacks, which never materialized, significantly prolonging the issue. 
* Holding of Funds Without Service : U.S. Bank has been holding my security deposit since XX/XX/year>, without providing me with the ability to use the XXXX XXXX  card I was approved for. 
* Excessive Review Time : A XXXX review period for faxed documents, after weeks of prior delays caused by U.S. Bank 's internal XXXX and misinformation, is unreasonable and further delays my access to my funds or the card. 
* Unacceptable XXXX XXXX : The prospect of waiting an additional month and a half to receive my own money back, should U.S. Bank decide to XXXX an account that was never properly activated or usable due to their failures, is completely unjust and financially XXXX 
This entire process reflects a severe lack of efficiency, transparency, and customer care on the part of U.S. Bank. I have spent significant time attempting to resolve an issue that originated entirely from U.S. Bank 's inability to properly activate my card and provide accurate, consistent information. This has resulted in XXXX financial XXXX incurred on my part.",Closed with explanation,6/3/2025

"CITIBANK, N.A.",Credit card,5/16/2025,WI,"On XX/XX/year>, I received emails from Citi informing me that the credit limits on two of my accounts ( ending in XXXX and XXXX ) had been reduced. These reductions took effect immediately, on the same day I was notified. There was no advance warning or lawful notice provided, in apparent violation of the CARD Act, which requires issuers to notify cardholders 45 days in advance of changes that may negatively affect them. 

At the time of the reductions, both of my account balances were already below the new limits. However, this sudden change caused my utilization ratio to spike dramatically, damaging my credit profile. I had not missed any payments, exceeded my limits, or engaged in adverse usage behavior. 

I reviewed the Notices and Letters section of my Citi online account and confirmed that no prior notice was posted, mailed, or otherwise issued before the action was taken. On XX/XX/year>, two days after the reduction, Citi retroactively posted letters dated XX/XX/year>, after the damage had already occurred. These notices appear backdated to appear timely, despite being uploaded and delivered after-the-fact. This raises concerns of deceptive timing and process manipulation.

JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,Credit card,7/29/2024,CA,"Subject : Unreasonable Forfeiture of Itinerary Value by Chase Travel Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to formally file a complaint against Chase Travel regarding an unreasonable forfeiture of itinerary value during a flight change process. Here are the details of my case : Flight Booking and Change Request : Original Booking : XXXX XXXX XXXX flight from XXXX to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, booked through Chase Travel for {$830.00}.

Change Request : A few days later, I decided to change the flight date to XX/XX/XXXX with the same departure and arrival locations and the same airline. The new flight fee was {$730.00}. 

During the change process on the Chase website, the system informed me that the fare difference of - {$100.00} would be forfeited. The payment summary stated, The modified trip costs less than the original itinerary value. The remaining value cant be applied to any airline change fees and will be forfeited. 

Communication with Chase Travel Specialist : Date : XX/XX/XXXX Time : XXXX XXXX Outcome : The operator read Chases policies and rules and informed me that I am not allowed to change to a lower fee flight and can only change to a flight with a higher fee. 

Complaints : XXXX. Unreasonable Forfeiture of Itinerary Value : Chases policy of confiscating the difference in fare when changing to a lower fee flight is unreasonable. Customers are required to pay an airline change fee, and when changing to a higher value flight, we need to pay the difference. However, when changing to a lower value flight, Chase does not return the difference nor apply it to the change fee, which is unfair to customers. 
XXXX. Lack of Transparency in Policies : During the booking process, Chases rules and policies do not adequately cover the scenario where a customer changes to a flight with a lower fare. The system only reveals this policy of forfeiture at the final step of payment during the flight change, which is not transparent and misleads customers into making decisions without full knowledge of the consequences. 
XXXX. Inconsistency and Miscommunication : Chases rules and policies are unclear, leading to inconsistencies even among their employees. The operator, after reading the rules, informed me that changes to a lower fee flight are not allowed. This contradicts the systems allowance of such changes, creating confusion and frustration for customers. It is unreasonable that Chases system permits the change but then imposes a forfeiture, which was not communicated upfront. 
XXXX. Potential Price Fluctuation Impact : Airline ticket prices fluctuate frequently. Currently, the price for the flight on XX/XX/XXXX is {$730.00}. I request Chase to address this matter promptly. If the resolution time is prolonged and the ticket price increases, I expect Chase to cover any additional costs incurred due to the delay.",Closed with explanation,7/29/2024

The reason : Since XX/XX/year>, my lender bank has been adding {$140.00} to my loan for hazard insurance fees. 
This misunderstanding was caused by the fact that I was out of the country when my loan bank sent me a letter asking me to update my property casualty insurance information. So I never saw the letter. 
It was not until I came back 4 months later that I saw a letter informing me that my hazard insurance had expired and asking me to update my hazard insurance information. 
I contacted the bank in time to inform them that the house I bought was cooperative and that the building had bought hazard insurance fees for our shareholders on time every year. I hope they stop collecting this fee immediately. 
In letters and phone calls, the bank told me not to worry. 
And promised that as long as I provided valid hazard insurance information, he would stop and refund me the money he had overcharged. 
The current situation is : My loan bank stopped charging this fee in XXXX of this year. ( I think the insurance information I provided is valid, otherwise they would not have stopped charging ) The bank charges 16 more months, {$140.00} more per month. A total of {$2200.00} ( {$400.00} has now been returned, and {$1800.00} remains unreturned ). 
However, the bank did not have any explanation. Tell me why I can't get a full refund.

WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,Checking or savings account,10/10/2024,CA,"On Monday XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email informing me by checking account 's balance was below XXXX. The email stated I had a GRACE PERIOD to XXXX XXXX to avoid overdraft fees. There was no additional information in the email about the account ( i.e., any pending bills ). On Tuesday at XXXX XXXX I made a deposit to bring the account fully back into positive territory ( aka, I deposited enough cash at the ATM to ensure if there was a pending bill, it would be paid ). Yet the same day, at XXXX XXXX I had received an email ( which I didn't know about until that evening as I'm not staring at my personal email XXXX times a day ) a bill was returned due to a negative balance on the account. That email stated the bill had been received by the bank on XX/XX/XXXX - since the account had a negative balance, by the following business day, the bill was returned to the payee. When I called to inquire why the bill wasn't paid even though the account was fully funded as of XX/XX/XXXX I was given the runaround regarding how the account didn't have overdraft protection and I would need a different account if I wanted it for the future. Likewise, Wells Fargo has repeatedly refused to answer my questions as to why their most basic account ( which I have - Clear Access ) is charged $ XXXX  monthly service fee ( and BTW, has no overdraft protection, nor does it have physical checks ) - yet XXXX of the ways to avoid a {$5.00} service fee on the one I have ( Clear Access ) or a {$10.00} service fee on their next highest account ( Everyday Checking, that does have overdraft protection and physical checks ) is to be between the ages of XXXX and XXXX. Evidently, when a person turns XXXX, that's when Wells Fargo can charge another {$5.00} in account fees ( why, they refuse to answer ). I want Wells Fargo to explain why there is a {$5.00} difference between their XXXX most basic accounts ( everything is digitally processed, and XXXX XXXX has no access to physical checks and and wouldn't use them for the XXXX XXXX account, so this is a moot point ) as well as, why there is an random age ( XXXX ) tied to when they can no longer charge any account fees.

My complaint pertains to their handling of multiple credit applications and my checking accounts, which has raised some grave concerns in regards to securities fraud and tax evasion per the Securities Exchange Act and from perusing the deposit contract, credit contracts, and the law governing my protection. My checking accounts were opened XX/XX/XXXX and I applied for personal credit multiple times since I had a relationship established with XXXX XXXX. The credit applications and my deposit account was securitized by XXXX XXXX where they also received a XXXX  number and engaged in trading activaties with my securities. According to research, Navy Federal operates under a 501 ( c ) 3, which is a non-for-profit bank, yet is charging me for late fees and overdraft fees. The NCUA clearly states that my overdraft fees are insured and should not be charged, showing negative on my account. 15 U.S. Code 1691 states that I can not be denied credit based on any discrimination. I sent a letter with my concern to the head of the legal department requesting documentary evidence on the matter of overdraft fees and the denial of credit and the basis of those multiple denials. I also revoke per ( 16CFR 433.1.2.3 ) requesting to STOP collecting interests on my checking account contracts and credit applications being sold, and all payments returned to me as I am the Invester and not the creditor nor the finance company ( which the contract is legally between per 16 CFR 433.1 ). Navy Federal is operating as Navy Federal Investment Services, LLC and Navy Federal Financial Group, LLC ( trustee company ) which according to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT STANDARD TERMS for Credit Unions can't be so. Besides the fraud that has happened through the overdraft fees and the denial of my credit applications, my livelihood and lot was worsened and diminished, and the it is reflecting adversely on my credit reporting, hindering my personal, family, and household pursuits of credit, employment, etc.",Closed with monetary relief,8/2/2024

Which we really dont want to have to pursue as we both work and our family is extremely busy as most are these days. 

The situation is this, my family and I are attempting to take cash out of our second home and we were approved to do so. We were approved based on the fact that I completed the modification process with Mr. Cooper and complied with all of the guidelines that XXXX XXXX  Required, ( see attached email from your office to Mr. Cooper ).

After numerous calls to the Servicer, they admitted that I needed to quit claim the property out of an LLC for that modification to be completed, but Mr. Cooper admitted that they had forgotten to tell me to do this ( which I have on a recorded call ), hence this caused the documents/process to expire forcing me into another modification process and three more trial payments.

Here is the impact, rates have gone up, the modification process is starting over again and now my current lender is stating that I need to make three payments and the modification has to be completed ( again ).

Navy Federal initially claimed that this information was confidential and could not be released, but on Thursday, Navy Federal stated that the funds were scheduled to be released on Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX. Once Navy Federal essentially admitted that the funds were being held due to the dollar amount and not because the check was deemed uncollectable, I asked Navy Federal for access to {$5500.00} because I believe that 12 CFR 229 requires release of {$5500.00} of the deposit by the second business day ( Wednesday ) when the reason for the funds hold is a large deposit. ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) Navy Federal refused this request and claimed that 12 CFR 229 does not apply to its organization.

I encourage CFPB to obtain Navy Federal 's recordings of the phone calls I had with them, in addition to copies of the e-Messages I had with Navy Federal.

I would like CFPB to request from Navy Federal for evidence supporting the "" reasonable cause '' for flagging my deposit as uncollectable, and I would like CFPB to determine if that determination was legitimate treatment of a US Treasury check.

I would like CFPB to evaluate whether Navy Federal should actually have classified my deposit as a "" large transaction '' instead of as an "" uncollectable transaction.

Each time, representatives acknowledged mishandling or automation errors, confirmed my disputes were legitimate, and made notes to escalate them including during an in-person branch meeting. The final call with a representative named XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX PM ) was especially concerning : she was unconfident, at XXXX point stuttering when I asked about review steps, and admitted I had been misinformed yet still upheld the denials. She also vaguely said documents would arrive in XXXX days, but could not clarify what they were or if they included merchant responses. 

These patterns suggest not just negligence, but systemic failure in Bank of Americas dispute process. Im requesting oversight because this has created both financial and procedural harm.

"CITIBANK, N.A.",Credit card,5/28/2025,CT,"XXXX XXXX Dear Sirs, I have all the proper documentation to prove that I am in fact me. I have had a Citi Bank Credit Card for close to thirty years. I have never missed a payment or had any trouble with my account in that period. I have done so well with Citi Bank that they have issued me a preferred member card. I am very proud of that fact. My credit card was recently stolen. After I made my last transaction at XXXX. I became upset when I couldnt find my card. So I spent some time looking for it. I didnt want to believe that someone would steal from me. I couldn't even imagine that. Then I started to realize that it was in fact stolen. So I proceeded to call Citi Bank to find out the situation. When my worst fears were realized. I was immediately transferred to the Citi Bank fraud department for suspicious charges made with my credit card. I became alarmed that this activity could still be going on. I was greeted by a Bank representative that was very unfriendly. After I gave her my card number, Social Security number & My Security Name. I proceeded to tell her that my credit card had been stolen. She then informed me that because I had the audacity to get a new cell phone this past year. She would not help me or close the account. I explained how ridiculous that was considering that I had the account for almost thirty years and I never had a problem. With the way cell phone prices are. I had to take the best deal that I could get. They wanted me to have a smart phone but I do not. I have the bottom of the barrel flip phone. I am lucky that it makes and receives calls. It is all I can afford at this time. I believe it is totally unreasonable to request such things in this tough economy. The bigger problem was that I wanted action taken so I tried to comply to her ridiculous demands. I finally convinced her to call me back. She made me wait for quite some time. Then when she finally did call back. She hung up on me like it was some big joke. 
I immediately called back and was transferred to a different woman. She then informed me that she would not close my account. She also informed me that she would not help me to rectify the situation. I told her that I had a preferred card and had been a loyal customer for over twenty years. I also told her that I had never missed a payment or had any issues before this problem. All that time meant nothing to her. She treated me like I had just opened an account. She didnt at all seem sympathetic to my plight. I guess a preferred card is just something that they give the peasants to make them feel special. After some back and forth about getting the issue resolved. I demanded that she take action. She informed me that they were going to send me a letter within seven to ten days. Meanwhile, the thief is running up the debt on my credit card. Worst of all he is ruining my credit. Which I will never be able to repair no matter the outcome. That will cause me serious hardship in my life. In an age where identity theft is running rampant in this country. I believe that their actions are unsatisfactory. Systems should be in place for such a big institution to resolve these issues swiftly. I would like to sue Citi Bank for Negligence and Incompetence. I would also like to seek damages for the Emotional and Mental anguish that I have encountered because of this terrible situation. I am also sending this letter to Consumer Protection because that is the address that I have. Regarding any questions you may have about this case.

WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,Mortgage,4/12/2024,FL,"I am attaching copies of the following so that those who view this case will be able to see exactly the issues I am encumbering from Wells Fargo Bank XXXX. 
XXXX. Copy of the XXXX with XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ( the XXXX ) is attached for all to view. In XXXX XXXX Banks response to my complaint : A sentence states the following : The payment terms for repayment require fixed payments of {$770.00}, for 20 years. My records indicate that I have a XXXX loan which matures XX/XX/XXXX. If XXXX XXXX will look at my monthly statements it also reflects the maturity date as XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. The recorded mortgage in XXXX XXXX XXXX pages XXXX states the maturity date of Secured Debt is XX/XX/XXXX. Is this another error you have quoted in your response or are you going to say it is correct like all the other errors you have made in processing my monthly payments. Please advise me in writing, no call. I need this in writing. It is obvious that you do not read the XXXX carefully and understand it well or you would see that my mortgage is a XXXX fixed-rate mortgage and not a XXXX mortgage. But, on the other hand perhaps you feel obligated to me for all the errors processed on my loan and plan to satisfy my loan in XXXX!!!! 
a. In the EquityLine with FlexAbility Agreement and Disclosure Statement ( the Agreement ) on page XXXX, SECTION XXXX, paragraph XXXX, see copy attached. Quote ( If my payments are not consistently made when due, the Final Fixed Rate Advance Minimum Monthly Payment XXXX not fully repay the Final Fixed Rate Advance over its term and my final payment for the Final Fixed Rate Advance XXXX be higher. The Bank will notify me in advance of any changes to my Total Payment Due as a result of the Final Fixed Rate Advance Minimum Monthly Payment. ) This statement is referring to me not making the monthly payments each month within the timeframe of the XXXX to the XXXX of each month. A grace period is a set length of time after the due date during which a payment XXXX be made without penalty. This is common in mortgage loans, insurance contracts, and credit cards. This XXXX period mentioned in the XXXX, is the grace or the courteous period. Wells Fargo Bank is failing to honor the XXXX period mentioned in the XXXX by sending out the monthly statement too soon. The monthly statement showing the current month as paid and the next month is due should go out no earlier that 14 days after the due date of the XXXX. Even if the monthly statement is sent out XXXX day past the grace period of 10 days, it would be in the mail to the customer 20 days prior to the due date of the next payment. So why is XXXX XXXX Bank sending out the monthly statement prior to the customer being able to take advantage of the XXXX grace period? Why? 
b. I make my monthly payment every month and it is always made before the end of the XXXX grace period. No where in my Agreement does it state that I will be penalized or charged more interest if I make my payment XXXX day past the XXXX ( the due date ) or make it on the XXXX day past the due date of the XXXX. My Agreement only refers to a late fee that XXXX be assessed if my payment is received past the grace period of 10 days. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX, Section XXXX, paragraph XXXX of the EquityLine with FlexAbility Agreement and Disclosure Statement ( the Agreement ) refer to the sentence that states : I will be charged a periodic FINANCE CHARGE based on the unpaid Final Fixed Rate Advance balance at the end of each day as a fixed Daily Periodic Rate. Interest is calculated daily on all loans and never stops till the loan is paid in full. The computer is programed to use the number of days given between each due date for the next payment due to determine the amount of interest to be paid for the next payment. Multiply the daily interest rate factor times the correct principal balance outstanding times the number of days between the due date and the next payment due to calculate the amount of interest the bank has earned and to be posted when the next payment is due to be made. No where in my Agreement does it state that Wells Fargo Bank has the written right to apply more interest than is calculated corrected for each monthly payment. No where in my Agreement does it state that Wells Fargo Bank has the right to apply my entire monthly payment to interest only. All my monthly payments have been made within the timeframe allowed, per my Agreement, and I have not missed XXXX payment. Exactly what it boils down to is, Wells Fargo is refusing to honor the XXXX Grace period and is trying to penalize me for exercise my rights to use it. 

XXXX. XXXX of XXXX XXXX to review starting at page XXXX and on to page XXXX, prepared by XXXX XXXX Bank. Please look at each transaction, but dont miss the ones from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX pages XXXX and XXXX, there are so many errors, compounded errors and reversals, credit, and debits that you will have to study it deeply to come up with an actual if or if not, that this was actually a fix. 
a. This XXXX was received from Wells Fargo Bank at my request and it shows how they posted each payment, principal and interest and the balance after the payment has been processed. The repayment date started XX/XX/XXXX at {$770.00} per month due on the XXXX of each month. This process begins on page XXXX and continues to page XXXX. I am attaching a copy of this statements so everyone can see all the actuals errors made by Wells Fargo Bank for themselves. This info only goes through XX/XX/XXXX, note that their errors have not stopped and they do continue to be made through XXXX. Wells Fargo Bank also stated in their response that there are no errors found in the application of payments to my account. Well, XXXX the viewer decide when they see my proof posted here today! 

XXXX. A Transaction Statement outlining the posting of each payment, the date payment was made, the postings of principal and interest with better accuracy than Wells Fargo Bank, the amount posted by Wells Fargo is written in on this statement for you to compare to see just how much this amount is over or under what it should have been. This XXXX XXXX was prepared by me. 
a. I have calculated each monthly payment as close to correct as possible, you can check it out for yourself. I am not stating that I am 100 % correct with each calculation, but I am saying that my figures are closer to being correct than Wells Fargo Banks. Review each transaction in each column. The E and G columns are my calculations, the F column is Wells Fargo Bank calculations. The H, I have indicated if correct, almost, under or over, the J column indicated the amount over or under that Wells Fargo has posted. Note beginning on page XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, there are so many reversals, debit, credits, repost, and adjustments that it is difficult to say it is fixed correctly as applied. See ages XXXX and XXXX in the Transaction Statement prepared by Wells Fargo Bank to view the many errors and corrections made by Wells Fargo Bank. 
XXXX. I have attached XXXX pages of my recorded mortgage so you can check on page XXXX the maturity date of my loan. 
Wells Fargo Bank keeps posting that they try to reach me by phone and there is nothing they could say any different to me in writing that would explain all the errors made by them, the fixes, the reversals, etc. However, they do keep saying that there are no errors found. I have no explanation to say why Wells Fargo Bank is applying my payments improperly. All these errors posted of my payments are erroneously applied and does not reflect a good management appearance.

All Wells Fargo Banks need to do is to change their statement issue date to XXXX days after the due date which gives the customer 20 days notice before their next payment is due and their statement will reflect that the current payment has been posted and posted correctly if they use the correct interest amount calculated between payments. Note to Wells Fargo Bank : Wells FargXXXX XXXX XXXX always sends out the mortgage statement XXXX ( XXXX ) days after the due date of my loan, which is due on the first ( XXXX ) of the month with a XXXX grace period ) and I have never ever had an issue of any kind showing an incorrect posting due to management or the processor. So why dont you get some good advice from them as to what you are doing wrong that messing up the posting of each XXXX of my payments? 
Wells Fargo, you continue to state that I am unreachable by phone. If I am so unreachable, then how is it that I am available to post and read through responses at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX? I have found that you, Wells Fargo, are the unreachable XXXX and this is why I have had to go through XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX!",Closed with explanation,4/16/2024

I have first demanded to remove the derogatory remarks on my credit report, and next, since I have paid the balance as a victim of this fraudulent account, I have demand the money back before filing a dispute in small claims court that would consider not only the balance that I paid ( {$130.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX ) but also the interest rate where my money would have saved ( high yield saving accounts that I have currently have a interest rate/APY of XXXX % ). I considered Macy 's lack of actions and irresponsibility have ruined my life despite me being a victim of identity theft and did my due diligence to ensure that I did my part to make this as transparent and as fair as I can. As far as I can tell, paying for an outstanding balance created by a perpetrator is not fair, nor do I suffer XXXX points deduction in my XXXX XXXX.

Within the XXXX hour window for cancellation I realized I needed to change my flights, and the only way to do so was the cancel the booking, which I did promptly and well within the XXXX hour window. 

I was promptly refunded the {$460.00} back to my credit card, but I never received the ThankYou Rewards points back to my account. I called CitiBank on XX/XX/XXXX to find out why my points had not been reinstated and I was told that it would take up to 30 days for the refund to be processed from the date of that phone call ( XX/XX/XXXX ), not XX/XX/XXXX, the day of the cancellation, because the department was "" backed up, '' and that there was "" only one person processing all Citi ThankYou Rewards point refunds '' for the whole company. 

Because I no longer had the XXXX rewards points available to me, I had to pay out of pocket to re-book my flights which was an burdensome expense I had not expected to have to pay when planning my trip that was originally booked using Rewards Points. XXXX  days later the points were still not refunded and I contact CitiTravel again. I was told to wait another XXXX  days.

It has now been XXXX  days since I cancelled my original flight booking and I am trying to plan another trip, for which I would like to use the XXXX points that I accrued throughout XXXX, and which should have been refunded upon cancelling my booking within the XXXX hour window on XX/XX/XXXX. The sum of money that those points are equivalent to, {$920.00}, is quite a lot of money for me. That amount of money could cover the entire cost of travel for me, but I am unable to use those points because Citi has not refunded them to me.

I sent my statements as requested, as well as documentation of the booking ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and the cancellation ( XX/XX/XXXX ) of my flights, with the amount credited back to my card that had been paid out of pocket, but no indication that Rewards points were ever reinstated. 

Since that last exchange, XXXX hours have passed. It has been 78 days since I cancelled my flight. I am still missing the refund from my flight cancellation on XX/XX/XXXX for a total of XXXX Citi ThankYou Rewards and I am unable to book another flight without them.

The failure of the Citi Travel Department andThankYou Rewards department to refund the Thank You Rewards Points that I accrued over time is entirely unacceptable. The fact that nobody has been able to connect me to a supervisor, or was willing or able to escalate the issue represents a systemic issue within the department.

It also came with a few others such as {$200.00} credit after spending x amount in the first three months ( Which i did ) anyways this is not the case. I realized on my first statement i was charged interest and have not received the {$200.00} credit like i applied for. I called and capitol one stated i did not apply for that card with those benefits. I went back to the application process that i originally filled out and again that is what was on the application and terms. After verifying i indeed applied for that card ( going through the entire process again without submitting it ) I explained to them there is a mistake somehow. They then told me since i did not do it off their website they couldnt do anything and that i again selected the card with "" fair '' credit and not excellent credit. Nowhere in the process of doing the application was there an option to choose anything like that. I went back to the application AGAIN on credit karma and when you hit continue to go through the application it brings you to capitol ones website to finish the application so saying it didnt do it on thier site is a LIE. It DID. And under those terms it was the same information i had applied for. All the information on the card details was the same that i applied for and yet theyre saying thats not correct. I have applied for two other cards in the previous year through third party and never got scammed like this both of those cards were exactly what i applied for. OMG. They wont do a single thing or let me talk to anyone they keep blowing me off and saying they cant convert the card WHICH TO I APPLIED FOR.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY,Credit card,4/27/2025,OH,"I am filing this complaint regarding a billing dispute that was mishandled by American Express. 

I was charged {$1500.00} and {$900.00} ( XXXX separate purchases ) by XXXX XXXX for goods and services that were not provided. Specifically, I purchased XXXX XXXX gift certificate credits during my visit. However, I was never given or able to use these credits, meaning a significant portion of the transaction involved goods that were never delivered. 

I filed a dispute with Amex based on non-receipt of goods/services, which is a valid basis under the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ). However, my dispute was denied solely because I had signed an authorization form at the club. Signing a form does not negate the merchants responsibility to deliver the purchased goods. 

I submitted a sworn statement to the credit card company explaining that the XXXX XXXX credits were never provided to me, but the credit card company refused to properly investigate this issue or consider the merchants failure to deliver the purchased items. 

I am requesting that Amex re-investigate the dispute properly, taking into account the non-receipt of goods/services, and issue a refund for the portion of the charge related to the undelivered XXXX Roses credits. 

Supporting documentation ( receipt, dispute statement ) can be provided if needed.",Closed with explanation,4/27/2025
WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,Checking or savings account,5/27/2025,CA,"Company : Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . 
Issue Type : Bank account or service Overdrafts and overdraft fees Im filing a complaint against Wells Fargo due to excessive and repeated overdraft fees that are consuming my entire payroll and worsening my financial situation. 

I rely on direct deposit for my income, but Wells Fargos overdraft system is causing serious financial harm. Each time my payroll hits, the funds are immediately applied toward a series of overdraft fees that quickly drain the entire deposit leaving me with little or no money for essentials like food, gas, or bills. 

Ive tried to resolve this directly with Wells Fargo by requesting a refund for these fees, but Ive been denied. The fees seem disproportionate to the activity in my account, and theyve been stacking {$35.00} fees hitting multiple times in a short window. Its a vicious cycle that makes it nearly impossible to recover financially. 

This is predatory behavior that targets customers living paycheck to paycheck. I am not trying to avoid responsibility I am trying to survive, and Wells Fargo is making that harder with every fee they apply. 

I would like Wells Fargo to refund the overdraft fees that have consumed my payroll and work with me on a solution to prevent this from happening again. I also want the CFPB to investigate Wells Fargos overdraft practices, as they are harming vulnerable customers and creating an inescapable cycle of debt.",Closed with explanation,5/27/2025

I called that morning and was told that I had to once again wait for my funds to settle in order for me to close my account. 

Once the funds had settled, I tried to transfer {$1100.00} ( my entire balance ) out of the Marcus account back into my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the transfer was reversed again and my account was once again locked. I called to figure out what the issue was and was told that the department I needed to be transferred to was closed. 

I once again called that morning and was transferred to a specialist who was supposed to be able to manually close my account, and give me back my money. After speaking to her, she said that the funds had to be divided and sent back to the respective accounts they came from.She lifted the hold and I sent two transfers out of Marcus to those accounts. Today I checked the update on the transfers and theyve once again been reversed, and my account is locked again. Im fed up and I am considering this as fraud and a blatant refusal to give me back my money. 

Ive read in some places and have been told over the phone that there is a 90 day limit to withdrawal money, but if thats the case then 1, why does it say I have available funds in the amount of {$1100.00}, and 2, why was this not disclosed when opening the account.",Closed with explanation,4/2/2024

I explained I had already done that and was transferred to banking. The agent just told me the same thing and that I had to talk to credit. They refused to send me to a live agent or provide an email address for direct contact. 

I made 15 calls and spoke to almost as many agents trying to get this solved and just get a copy of the terms and conditions and to clarify my intro rate.

The lender we purchased our home from sold our loan to XXXX. So we pursued doing a cash out refinance with them and closed on that loan with XXXX XX/XX/XXXX 2022. To ensure that our taxes and insurance was accounted for we opted for Impounds to make sure they were covered. Our mortgage payment went up about {$300.00} ish dollars more a month bringing it to {$2900.00} a month. We have lived here for not quite two years now. Yesterday I got an email from XXXX saying that our payment was going to be updated due to the recent Escrow Analysis they had done on XX/XX/XXXX. I was beyond shocked and worried sick to find out that there was a {$7000.00} shortage in our escrow account and that we had to either pay {$7000.00} before XX/XX/XXXX or our mortgage would be going up to {$3900.00} a month to cover that deficit.

We believe that the loan officer / XXXX  undercut the taxes and insurance so that we would qualify for the loan to keep the debt to income ratio low and payment below {$3000.00} and to obtain the business.

I am particularly troubled by the following issues : Unwarranted Escrow Charges : Despite providing proof of full insurance coverage, Mr. Cooper and XXXX have charged me an additional {$180.00} in escrow. This charge appears unjustified, given that my insurance coverage meets all required standards. The continued imposition of this fee suggests either an error or an attempt to exploit my situation for additional revenue. 

Excessive Interest Rate Adjustments : My mortgage agreement purportedly includes an adjustable interest rate, which has been raised to the maximum allowable rate of XXXX percent. This adjustment results in a monthly payment of {$1800.00} on a {$200000.00} mortgage. While interest rates are known to fluctuate, it is concerning that the rate was increased to its peak during a period of rising rates without a corresponding decrease when rates dropped.

I immediately contacted my CPA on XX/XX/XXXX via email asking what this notice was. On XX/XX/XXXX, our CPA replied stating that it appeared that the IRS was not crediting us for a payment in the amount of {$230000.00} that was mailed to the United States Treasury on XX/XX/XXXX and advised to request a cancelled check. I contacted Wells Fargo Banks customer service to request a copy of the cashed check which was emailed to me within the hour. Upon opening the document, I saw that the check that was processed for payment was not made payable to the United States Treasury, but to an individual 's name that I did not write the check too. I contacted Wells Fargo to file my claim on the same day, XX/XX/XXXX. I advised when submitting my claim that I have online banking and do not receive physical copies of the checks returned to me and that I validate the check numbers and amounts and do not click on every single item to view the checks. The Wells Fargo claims representative advised that due to the length of time that had lapsed from when the fraud occurred and the date that I reported the fraud and that it was ultimately my responsibility to verify the checks being present against my account. I was then advised that I would need to wait up to 10 business days to hear a response from Wells Fargo Bank on my claim. I was also advised that due to the large dollar amount of the claim that most likely a senior claims representative would be contacting me to get further details. I did receive a call on Monday XX/XX/XXXX to whom I provided the details of the fraud. At that time I also pointed out to the claims representative that the check that had been presented for payment and processed by Wells Fargo Bank did not have my husbands name spelled correctly and that the fraudulent check had additional writing on the top of the check that our checks do not have. I asked her if she needed a copy of the original check that I had on file, as I keep all tax records on file, to see the difference between the checks, and she advised that it was not necessary but that if it made me feel better I can fax it to them. And I did fax them another statement along with all of my documentation on the XXXX of XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from Wells Fargo Bank stating that our claim was denied due to the length of time that had lapsed and that they no longer had the recourse to recover the funds from the beneficiary bank. I was appalled not only because we were robbed of {$230000.00}, but that Wells Fargo refused to take any further action into investigating this crime. It was obvious that the check had been deposited into this individual 's account and there is further information that can be revealed with the depository bank, but Wells Fargo said that they would not pursue any further action on my behalf until we signed a "" Hold Harmless Agreement '' with Wells Fargo Bank. When I asked for clarification on what this meant, the claims representative stated that it would relieve Wells Fargo from any financial liability for our lost funds and that they would then attempt to recover as much of the funds from the beneficiary bank, if any funds were still available in the account that the money was deposited into. I advised that I would discuss it over with my husband and left it at that. Wells Fargo then called my husband on the XXXX of XXXX, asking him to come into a branch to sign the agreement, at which point he advised that we would not be signing the hold harmless agreement and would take legal action. I feel that Wells Fargo failed to fulfill their due diligence by letting a check that did not have my husband 's name spelled correctly on the check. The depository agreement we signed with Wells Fargo when we opened this account was under the legal name of my husband and myself, not the name that the fraudulent check was printed out as. Wells Fargo failed to check all of the items that should have been checked prior to releasing the funds. And Wells Fargo, as a federal institution, should do whatever they can to support crimes as what happened to us, to research and investigate to protect other consumers in the future. Wells Fargo was quick to blame me stating that I failed to look at my checks in a timely manner, but Wells Fargo failed us first by not checking that the check that was presented for payment was valid with the correct spelling of my husband 's name. We signed a legal agreement to manage our account with Wells Fargo 's depository agreement with our correct names, not the name that this fraudulent check was processed in. We should not be held liable for these lost funds when our legal agreement with Wells Fargo is under the correct name as shown on my check copy, but the fraudulent check. Somewhere from when I put our tax payment in the mail, our check was stolen and we have now been a victim of identity theft and fraud that Wells Fargo is not willing to take any responsibility for or even attempting to catch the criminal ( s ) involved as contacting the beneficiary bank to get the account holder 's information would be accessible.

The payment was rejected and the amount was sent back to paypal credit/synchrony bank however , it now says that my balance is- {$5800.00} which is not accurate and which will impact my credit score.

I believe it is illegal to reduce someone's line of credit below their current balance as that would put them in the negative and I believe paypal credit/synchrony bank purposefully processed this invalid payment so they could reduce my line of credit and impact my credit score negatively.

Chime Financial Inc,Checking or savings account,8/4/2024,VA,"I am writing to file a complaint against Chime regarding their handling of an unauthorized charge on my account. Despite taking steps to block the vendor and initially having the charge reversed, the bank later reversed their decision, causing significant distress and financial inconvenience. 

Details of the Complaint Unauthorized Charge : On XX/XX/year>, a charge of {$99.00} was made to my account by an XXXX XXXX XXXX without my authorization. 
Upon noticing the charge, I immediately contacted Chime ] to report the unauthorized transaction. 
Initial Reversal : Chime conducted a preliminary review and reversed the charge, crediting my account on XX/XX/year>. 
Blocking the Vendor : To prevent further unauthorized charges, I requested Chime to block XXXX XXXX XXXX from making any further transactions on my account. 
Reversal of Reversal : Despite my actions to block the vendor, Chime reversed their initial decision and will re-apply the charge to my account on XX/XX/year>, citing their belief that the charge was authorized. 
Issues Raised Failure to Protect Consumer : By re-applying the charge, Chime failed to protect me as a consumer, disregarding my explicit request to block the vendor and my assertion that the charge was unauthorized. 
Inadequate Investigation : The bank 's investigation into the unauthorized charge appears to be inadequate, as they reversed their initial decision without providing sufficient justification. 
Financial and Emotional Distress : The re-application of the charge has caused me financial hardship and significant stress, as I am now held accountable for a charge I did not authorize. 
Requested Resolution I kindly request the CFPB to : Investigate Chime for their handling of unauthorized charges and their procedures for investigating such claims. 
Ensure that Chime reverses the unauthorized charge and any associated fees permanently. 
Require Chime to improve their procedures for blocking unauthorized vendors and handling customer disputes. 
Provide compensation for the inconvenience and distress caused by their mishandling of this issue. 
Supporting Documentation I have attached the following documents to support my complaint : Bank statements showing the unauthorized charge and subsequent reversals. 
Correspondence with Chime regarding the unauthorized charge and my request to block the vendor.

XXXX email from Marcus stating to call them.

This is impossible as I gave them the FACTS of my life that they asked for. They wouldn't tell me what I supposedly got 'wrong '. They immediately said the only way to authenticate me is to send me out a packet that I have to fill out, notorize and send back. I would receive it within 7-10 days. 
XXXX Still NO packet. I called stating I want access to my money and now want to CLOSE my entire account. XXXX said no supervisors were available until Monday, and reiterated what had previously been said. She said she'd try to reauthenticate me another way ; by sending a code to another phone number ( I only have one cell phone number, like most people ), and then asked what state my driver 's license was issued in. When I said, New Jersey, she said, 'no, that's not a state that we can work with.

Mr. Cooper Group Inc.,Mortgage,5/14/2025,TX,"Between XXXX and XXXX, I submitted multiple loss mitigation applications to my mortgage servicer ( initially XXXX XXXX now Mr. Cooper ) under a USDA-guaranteed home loan. Despite submitting complete and timely documentation, XXXX repeatedly denied my applications, often claiming they were incomplete without basis. I have records showing successful uploads and confirmations of receipt. 

In XXXX and XXXX, I requested assistance following a COVID-19 forbearance. Under USDA HB-1-3555 guidelines ( Ch. 18 ), if a borrower does not qualify for standard options, the servicer is required to submit a servicing exception request to USDA. Despite my eligibility, no exception was submitted. This was confirmed by USDA staff, who found no record of any such request in their system. 

During active loss mitigation review, XXXX moved forward with foreclosure-related steps, which appears to violate 12 CFR 1024.41 ( f ), the federal dual-tracking rule that prohibits initiating foreclosure while an application is under review. At no point was I given a fair opportunity to cure any supposed deficiencies.

In 2023, I obtained legal counsel and filed suit against the servicer. In their Motion for Summary Judgment, they made statements about my modification history and eligibility that I can prove were false. I am currently appealing that judgment. 

Additionally, I submitted a FOIA request to USDA to verify whether the servicer had ever communicated with them about my case. The absence of USDA involvement calls into question whether proper oversight occurred over this federally backed loan. 

I am asking the CFPB to investigate : The mishandling and premature denial of my loss mitigation applications, The servicers failure to request a USDA servicing exception, The improper continuation of foreclosure activity during an open review, False statements made in legal proceedings that contradict internal records. 

This issue has placed my family at serious risk of losing our home. I am requesting urgent review, appropriate enforcement, and communication from the company with a clear explanation of their servicing conduct and USDA compliance.",Closed with explanation,5/14/2025

t. As a loyal customer for over a decade, I have invested considerable trust and confidence in the institution 's services. However, the abrupt decision to terminate my account has not only inconvenienced me but also jeopardized my ability to engage in financial transactions with both Bank of America and other institutions. Despite possessing a comprehensive understanding of banking practices, I found myself confronted with an unjustifiable closure and subsequent limitations on my banking options. Within a brief span, I inadvertently filed three claims, each stemming from legitimate grievances. The first incident occurred during the week of XX/XX/XXXX when malfunctioning washers at a laundromat necessitated my involvement in multiple refund requests. Despite my efforts to rectify the situation through the appropriate channels, I was met with unsatisfactory resolutions, exacerbating my financial inconvenience.

On XX/XX/XXXX, a XXXX transaction for services not rendered prompted further action on my part. Despite attempts to communicate with the recipient, my efforts were fruitless, leaving me at a loss.

Furthermore, a purchase of a money order at USPS on XX/XX/2024, resulted in a protracted ordeal involving XXXX XXXX. Despite the tardiness in their response, compounded by the partial completion of the money order, I diligently pursued resolution to no avail. Throughout these challenges, I diligently engaged with Bank of America, seeking clarification and recourse for each issue. Regrettably, the limitations imposed on the number of claims within a specified timeframe hindered my ability to seek redress adequately. Moreover, a recent incident on XX/XX/2024, wherein my card malfunctioned during a transaction at XXXX, further underscores the deficiencies in Bank of America 's service. The subsequent interaction with a customer service representative, characterized by a lack of comprehension and relevance, only compounded my frustration.

In light of these events, I implore Bank of America to reevaluate its policies regarding account closures and customer service. As a loyal patron, I deserve transparency, accountability, and timely resolution of grievances. Failure to address these concerns adequately will compel me to explore alternative banking options.

Despite this confirmation, multiple follow-up calls to Amex customer service have resulted in my being denied the XXXXpoint bonus.

I requested a review of the call logs to confirm the offer made on XX/XX/XXXX, but my requests have been met with unhelpful responses, leaving the issue unresolved.

The promotion was advertised by Chase as a interest free balance transfer until XX/XX/2024. However Chase did not fully and clearly explain that full payments on my standard daily purchases for each monthly cycle would not be applied to those purchases. I have paid off my Credit Card balances every month for years on ALL of my Credit Cards.

I have done balance transfers in the past with other banks/CC and paid each monthly balance off and paid off the promotional balances by the end date of the promotion with no interest! 
Chase has been allocating some of my monthly payments towards the pay down of the promotional balance and charging interest on my daily purchases. 
The promotion was misleading and so is the so called "" How to avoid paying interest on purchases '' description on page 2 of my monthly statement. The advertisement for the promotion never clearly described how interest was charged. The promotion said in big bold letters balance transfers would be interest free until XX/XX/2024. 
I have received one letter from Chase and the letter did not address my complaint I filed regarding my concern for the inaccurate XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX statement, In fact the letter stated I was being charged XXXX interest?

The next day he went into the bank in XXXX to talk to the supervisor and a member of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX met him there so that they could prove that the check was legit. The supervisor questioned the board member and made her show proof she was who she said she was which is okay but unfortunately, the proof she showed still wasnt good enough.

"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",Credit card,3/12/2024,MD,"Date : XXXX XXXX 2024 XXXX Hello, I am reaching out on the basis that Bank Of America has failed to follow proper procedures in notifying me about the closure of an account. 

XXXX XXXX 2024, I made a payment to my credit card, it was over the limit and i had paid it down entirely to lower my utilization as well to utilize it again. I was behind on 2 monthly payments and i made sure to be caught up the payments as soon as I could. This month, before the 3rd rollover cycle ( the statement date, which was XX/XX/XXXX ) I paid this card down. It took a few days [ XX/XX/XXXX ] to update on my account and then finally i saw an available balance of XXXX remaining on the card. I went to go pay my phone bill with it and noticed that it was not working ... .I didn't know why? I had just paid for it. 

XXXX XXXX, 2024 XXXX, I decided to get in touch with Bank of America via app. I got in touch with one of their specialist named XXXX, whom told me that the account was closed... I was confused because i just paid this down? Why? And more importantly, when did the account close? I paid it down XX/XX/XXXX... 

I have physical evidence that the moment i paid the credit card down, they closed the account over the weekend. He then went further to state that a letter was sent out in regards to this and it would arrive in 7-10 business days notifying me of the account being closed. When i asked and had a complaint about lack of being notified 30 days prior and the proper steps, the individual closed the chat while i was in mid-sentence of communicating. 

XXXX XXXX, 2024 XXXX Frustrated, i decided to get in touch with a physical agent at Bank of America XXXX I then got in touch with a woman named XXXX from the California Branch. I called to initially figure out if there was a way to resolve the manner and the process to go about this lack of communication on behalf of a bank and lack of notification THE INSTANT i paid the credit card down... She went further to tell me and confirm, there wasn't a letter sent out yet. This let me know immediately that Bank of America closed the account the moment i paid it down and failed to follow the proper protocol in notifying me of such a close. They failed to communicate to me at least 30 days prior of late payments, or even a closing of the account before it was closed. This card is still open on my Bank of America app, saying that I'm still obligated to make monthly payments as if the account is still active and open... I told XXXX on the phone that if I was out of town and this was the only card I had accessibility to use and i paid it down so that i could use it, the very same bank that issued it to me would have inconvenienced me TREMENDOUSLY due to not properly notifying me 30 days prior to its closing... .What 's worse ... Ms. XXXX wanted to confirm my address as well to have the letter sent out ... This was the frustrating part because on the call she, and the other agent [ XXXX ] had told me a letter was already sent out and now they're asking for my information and address to send the letter... .I declined and told them that Bank of America failed to follow the necessary steps to send this to me and decided to transfer this to a collection agency. I did not authorize, nor give consent to close this account, I was not offered the ability to pay this down to continue to maintain this account in anyway, shape or form. Bank of America took my money and closed the account down the same day i paid it down immediately without notifying me the necessary reasons for it. I asked XXXX to please list the reasons for why the account was closed and she failed to give me the reasons for it.. 

I asked the representative if this call was on a recorded line... She confirmed that this call was recorded and Bank of America has this... Please review this call as it is information that supports the claims of this complaint. 

This is going to affect my credit... What's worse, they sold my information to a collection agency without my consent.

"BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION",Checking or savings account,5/1/2025,TX,"Subject : Bank of America Unauthorized CD Auto-Renewal , Lack of Notification, and Unfair Penalties I am submitting this formal complaint regarding the handling of two Certificate of Deposit ( CD ) accounts I opened with Bank of America , one CD for XXXX USD and the other for XXXX USD. 

I opened these CDs with the explicit intention of using the funds to pay my federal taxes XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2025. I manage all of my finances digitally through Bank of America 's online and mobile platformsincluding both my personal and business accounts. I opened the CDs online and expected to be able to track their terms, maturity, and availability in the same way.

However, throughout the CD term, no maturity date was visible in the app or online platformonly the account balance. I received no email, no app notification, no phone call, and no mailed reminder about the CDs maturing or the need to take action to prevent automatic renewal. I was completely unaware that the funds would be rolled over without any confirmation or approval from me.

When I finally called to inquire why I couldnt access the funds, I was told that both CDs had been automatically renewed and the grace period to make changes had already passed. I was further told that I would now be charged penalties to withdraw the funds. At no point during setup or the CD term did anyone inform me that I would have to call Bank of America on or near the maturity date in order to avoid these CDs from renewing. This is an unreasonable expectation, especially in a modern banking environment where nearly all interaction is conducted digitally.

I understand Bank of America claims this policy is outlined in the "" terms and conditions, '' which they allege were sent via mail. However, I never received nor saw these documents. As a digital banking customer, I reasonably expect critical terms that affect access to my funds to be clearly and prominently disclosed in the online experiencenot buried in paper mail I never requested, or in fine print that was never highlighted during the online signup process. Auto-renewal with financial penalties should never be opt-out by omission.

Furthermore, when I asked them to flag the CDs today to prevent further automatic renewal, Bank of America refusedstating I would have to call again within a very specific window ( a few days before the maturity date ) to stop it. This places an unreasonable burden on customers and increases the likelihood of repeat penalties through system design, not customer negligence.

I am requesting : A full waiver of all early withdrawal penalties for both CD accounts.

Immediate access to the CD funds.

A written assurance that auto-renewals will not happen again without my explicit, affirmative consent.

A digital copy of the terms and conditions I allegedly agreed to, for my records.

I believe this practice violates principles of transparency and fairness in consumer banking. If this issue is not resolved promptly and satisfactorily, I intend to escalate the matter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ), and other relevant regulatory bodies.",Closed with explanation,5/1/2025

The way I was treated at this location was discriminatory, unprofessional, and caused me XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Incident Summary : On the morning of XX/XX/year>, I accidentally transferred {$2000.00} from my Wells Fargo account to my XXXX bank account instead of the other way around, resulting in a negative balance of approximately {$2000.00} in my Wells Fargo checking account. I promptly called Wells Fargos customer service line and was informed that the funds would bounce back in a few business days, and that my balance would return to normal. 

Later that day, I went to the XXXX XXXX branch to request a cashiers check for {$1900.00} from my savings account, which had sufficient funds. I urgently needed the check to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and avoid losing the XXXX, as I was transitioning out of an XXXX and did not have nearby family support. 

At the branch, the banker initially refused to issue the cashiers check, citing the negative balance in my checking accounteven though I made clear that the savings account had the full amount needed. I calmly explained the situation, including the mistake and the incoming funds from my external account. I even offered to immediately re-transfer the {$2000.00} from my XXXX account to temporarily correct the issue. 

In response, the banker stated she could not issue the check due to past transactions. When I respectfully asked her to clarify which specific transactions she was referring to, she was unable to answer. Instead, she left to consult with coworkers in the back and returned with the same refusal and a dismissive attitude. The entire interaction felt demeaning and discriminatory, as if I were being judged rather than supported as a loyal customer in a difficult situation. 

Eventually, she issued the cashiers checkbut the XXXX XXXX was already done. I left the branch feeling XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX during a vulnerable and time-sensitive situation. 



Impact : I experienced XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
I was treated in a dismissive and discriminatory manner, not reflective of the standards expected from a reputable financial institution. 
The banker could not provide a clear or policy-based explanation for the refusal, which appeared arbitrary and unjustified.

2. Compensation for the XXXX XXXX and financial hardship I experienced. 
3. A formal review and investigation into the conduct of the staff at the XXXX XXXX XXXX branch. 
4. Assurance that staff will be trained or retrained to handle situations like mine with empathy, clarity, and respect.

We do not expect to provide information so that it could be used to start disservicing the mortgage and attempt to inform us about disinformation by providing lack of transparency, limitation on options, ignoring the facts we presented, and undermined the platform and misinterpreted the terms.

Its been that way for the past few years. Today, I log onto my online banking and see a checking account that was opened. This account was NEVER authorized by me to be opened. I called into customer service, there was a bit of a wait time, so I had to hang up as I had a meeting I had to be in. After my meeting I called back and spoke with the fraud department. The representative was very kind and she closed the account, said someone must have stolen my identity. I understand hackers and how they can steal your information. Ive gone through all the steps to protect my identity. All of my credit reports are locked down. I use strong passwords. I dont click on any outside links that Im not expecting. Not saying it cant be done, but its harder to get me than some of my peers. 

The representative told me that the account was opened online. That means someone would have to know my user name and password. I was baffled at this. How could someone open a checking account in my name at a bank where I have an existing relationship and that bank not as much send me an email to say you have a new account. The account that was opened happened to be opened using an old address. Still nothing from Bank of America to say hey your address was changed in our system. Im not sure if you keep old addresses on file, but that old address is my Mothers address. Im still baffled by this, now why would someone who was trying to steal my identity and for some odd reason open an account in my name at an institution that I have an existing relationship with use my mothers address. 

So now Im thinking this has to be an inside job. Is there a banker somewhere trying to reach a goal and is opening up accounts fraudulently? It said the account was open on XX/XX/2023. Banks were closed. That was a Sunday. No one logged into my online banking. Below is a screenshot of my logins per online banking. There was no login on using my id and password.

It was then when I found out through technical support that they had sent me a debit card to the wrong address/not sent it at all and seeing I never confirmed it placed me in an account hold since XXXX.

There was no email correspondence or updates that a new card was being mailed out or to confirm the card unlike the messaging I got from XXXX XXXX and XXXX.

I asked Chase to put a stop to these pending reversal transactions and I was told that they could not stop it. Because of their actions, Im in the process of losing my house. 

Chase claims that I authorized these transactions and provided private information to another individual. Chase is aware that I, personally m, did not make the reversal requests that were done on my account. 

In order to make things right, chase would need to refund the money that was not authorized by me to the merchants that had been paid already. Chase did not see that 16 reversals in three days was a red flag and went ahead with the transactions.",Closed with explanation,4/10/2024

DISCOVER BANK,Mortgage,4/30/2024,FL,"Subject : Concern Regarding HELOC Appraisal Process with Discover Bank I am writing to address some concerns I have regarding the recent appraisal process for my home equity line of credit ( HELOC ) application with Discover Bank. 

During the initial stages of the application process, my home was valued at {$800000.00}, which positively impacted the offered interest rate. However, I was surprised to find that the subsequent appraisal conducted by Discover was only a drive-by appraisal, resulting in a significantly lower valuation of {$620000.00}. This disparity had a substantial impact on the terms of the HELOC. 

Despite expressing my reservations about the accuracy of the drive-by appraisal, Discover declined to conduct a full appraisal or consider alternative valuation methods. Additionally, they refused to accept another appraisal to provide a second opinion on the property 's value. Instead, I was informed that I could only challenge the drive-by appraisal, with little likelihood of affecting the outcome. 

I am concerned that Discover 's handling of the appraisal process may not align with industry standards or regulatory requirements. I believe I have not been given a fair opportunity to obtain an accurate valuation for my property, which is essential for securing favorable terms on my HELOC.

My payment was due XX/XX/XXXX, a Saturday. On Sunday, XX/XX/XXXX, I went as instructed to the XXXX website to pay my loan, which immediately forwarded to Shellpoint 's website. There was no way to pay online, except to register, which I did. I received a message that I would get information to pay online when they set up my file. No email has been received in follow up from Shellpoint in the last XXXX hours. 

I called the number that was on Shellpoint 's website : XXXX, and because the welcome letter did not have my account number on it, was placed on hold for 1 hour and 18 minutes. I finally gave up and tried again, this time using my XXXX  account number, entering it electronically using my phone touchpad. That took me to a customer service representative after a 5-minute hold, and this call took 33 minutes. 

This call was recorded and the person on the other end of the call could only identify the amount of my payment. She could not find my loan in her system, nor any matching social security number. When she located the property address, the last 4 digits of the social security number were not correct. I asked if I would get a receipt. She said within 24 hours. I asked when I would learn of my new account number. She said that would be when it was created with no statement of timeframe. Basically, she could not tell me. 

I asked her if she had my email address, and she said no, but when the payment was entered into the system, it would have my email address and notify me that the payment was made. 

I told her I was not comfortable giving her my bank account number over the phone for a {$4600.00} payment without adequate safeguards such as getting a receipt and knowing that the payment would be properly applied. She kept asking me if I was ready to pay. I noted that if Shellpoint could not find me in their system, how could I be sure they could actually apply the payment and not lose it. I asked to speak to a manager and she said that was not possible. She also pressured me saying my payment was due and that there was no grace period.

I noticed the error during the call, and the representative acknowledged it, assuring me that the dispute amount would be corrected. However, the next day ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I saw that the amount had not been changed, so I called back immediately to follow up. Once again, Citibank acknowledged the error and said it would be corrected but it never was. 

I also submitted all of the requested documentation that same day, which clearly stated the correct dispute amount of {$13000.00}. This included my contract, a payment breakdown, and evidence of incomplete work. Despite this, Citibank continued to process the dispute using the incorrect amount of {$1200.00} completely ignoring both the documentation and the correct amount I submitted on time. 

This was entirely a Citibank internal error.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that the dispute had been marked resolved, and Citibank made the incorrect {$1200.00} credit permanent.

I did not believe this was accurate. They told me not to worry since it was already closed. I didn't like this response.

Today, I went to use the Sapphire card to purchase travel through the Chase XXXX portal. I happen to look at my profile and it shows my maiden name, which is associated with the XXXX account. I called Chase XXXX. He confirmed that had I booked the flight, it would have been in my maiden name. This would have been an awful travel experience. Chase XXXX transferred me to Chase XXXX XXXX. At first, the rep told me that I had to send name change documents. After I protested, they transferred me to a supervisor. The supervisor was told my name was wrong on my replacement card. I told her my card was correct but it was wrong on the travel portal. First she said it would take 14 days, then she needed some time to resolve it over the phone. She came back to say she ordered a replacement. I don't know why. I don't want a replacement. Then she wanted me to go through some other verification. She said to correct the travel portal but I don't know why I would need to verify my identity since I am an existing customer and the internal systems are out of sync. I refused.

"CITIBANK, N.A.",Credit card,5/30/2024,NM,"Noted on Citi Credit card statement that amount due for payment was {$3800.00}. 

Spend/purchases for the billing period was {$3200.00} I Paid {$2500.00} before due date However CIti calculated interest ( {$80.00} ) based upon total total spent of $ XXXX@ 28.24 % APR for the 32 days billing period and not on the outstanding balance of of approximately {$1300.00} after payments were made. 

When questioned, Citi indicated that because the statement balance was not paid in full the interest was applied. 

I would expect the interest to be applied to the outstanding balance and not the full purchases for the billing period. 

I consider this illegal/criminal and unfair, and not consistent with accounting/financial principles. 

I complained to CITI and further indicated that i will be making a complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 

Citi response also that this method of calculating interest was their standard practice and also the practice across the credit card industry. 

I would like for the CFPB to intervene in this matter and if standard practice across the credit card industry to make changes to enforce that interest be calculated on outstanding balance after due date and not on the purchases during the billing period if the statement is not paid in full.

The tickets original price was {$3700.00} for both tickets. On XX/XX/2023, My dad ( XXXX XXXX XXXX age of XXXX XXXX XXXX ) fell off the stairs and was subjected to XXXX and a XXXX record was attached. I contacted XXXX and they requested the medical record and my brother XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sent it over to them. After their review of medical records, XXXX has canceled the reservation and XXXX has been added to my XXXX account for future travel. 
Right before the XXXX XXXX, my dad was subjected to a checkup to determine the amount of XXXX XXXX that could be used for the XXXX, unfortunately, his XXXX efficiency was too low to take any XXXX. The doctors figured out a way to get him to the XXXX without being XXXX 
After the XXXX XXXX  and my fathers recovery and the XXXX removal, I planned to rebook new tickets for my parents again but prior to this, a new checkup was done to get medical approval for my dad 's travel. Unfortunately, the XXXX  rejected my fathers travel and stated that there is a risk for my dad to get on an airplane as his XXXX functionality is too low as a result of the XXXX received for his XXXX treatment in the past, as well as the huge risk on his life in his age after such XXXX. My brother contacted the XXXX XXXX with the doctor 's medical reports and the company did two things : 1. Emailed him back with this : We would like to inform you that we have refunded below tickets to the original form of payment. 
2. They REMOVED THE XXXX OF {$3700.00} FROM XXXX. 
At this point, the companys answer was clear that they would issue a full refund and not a partial as it was never stated. Additionally, the XXXX  on XXXX was removed, which make sense because they will issue a full refund to the original payment method as they stated in an official email. 

The problem starts here, as XXXX XXXX did not issue the refund as mentioned. they provided {$110.00} per ticket as a refund. Therefore, It doesnt make any sense to lose {$3700.00} XXXX on XXXX and in return get {$110.00} per ticket as a refund. I would have kept the XXXX  and requested being transferred to my account to use it to go visit my parents if I knew that they would only return {$110.00} per ticket. The airline stated in an official email explicitly We would like to inform you that we have refunded the below tickets to the original form of payment, and right after this email, the XXXX  disappeared from XXXX which means that they will refund tickets to the original form of payment as mentioned in their email. 

Based on all the above, It was very obvious that the airlines were not honest. Therefore, I've requested a dispute through Chase Bank providing all the documents requested by the bank. 

Unfortunately, Chase Bank was not supporting me as their customer, they were against me and took the other side in a way completely unprofessional. They didn't even show any intention to use my documents, they didn't even listen to me and forced the dispute case to be closed. Anything the airline said was for granted to Chase Bank, however, every word I said was documented but Chase Bank did not care to investigate my case. The airlines provided false information to Chase Bank such as : 1- I still have XXXX on XXXX ( Which is not correct, they got back after their official email about the refund ). 
2- They issued a partial refund of {$110.00} as the equivalent of not used, airport fees and taxes, XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX ( which is not correct ) 3- They mentioned in an official letter to the bank "" The customer may still place a refund request and ask XXXX to examine this case on its merits ''. ( Which happened already, and I got official email from the airlines saying "" We would like to inform you that we have refunded below tickets to the original form of payment '' ). But chase bank has ignored my documents as usual. 

In Summary, I have provided the bank and the XXXX airline with all evidence from medical records, the reply from the airline ( official refund emails ), the XXXX email initiated on the first request, and evidence that the XXXX was removed by not showing on the account anymore. 

Hence, I am not accepting the companys reasons for rejecting the dispute. They were not honest from the beginning and tried making use and taking advantage of the XXXX XXXX SITUATION that my father has been going through. Furthermore, the bank didn't seem to be protecting me as their client and simply rejected the dispute so just as the company replied to them even with all the evidence I have supplied.

"CITIBANK, N.A.",Credit card,6/6/2025,SC,"What happened : I have a XXXX XXXX credit card issued by Citibank, which I applied for and used once online to purchase appliances. I never activated the physical card that was mailed to meit has remained in my locked safe, still unactivated with the original activation sticker. 

On XX/XX/year>, I noticed an unexpected auto-debit from my checking account for a minimum payment to Citi. My XXXX XXXX card has had a {$0.00} balance for years, so I logged into my account and discovered a new, unauthorized transaction for {$1900.00}. I immediately contacted Citibank to report it as fraud. This is Case # XXXX according to their records. 

While following up with XXXX XXXX and Citis fraud teams, I was told the purchase occurred in-store and that the item had later been returned for cash. This was especially concerning, as it indicates someone used my account fraudulently, and the store and Citi allowed the transaction and refund to occur without properly verifying identity or card activation status. 

Despite my immediate fraud report, and despite the physical card never being activated or used, Citibank sent me a letter on XX/XX/year> stating thatbecause the transaction happened near where I livethey have determined it was not fraud and are rebilling the charge to me. 

Why Im filing this complaint : Citibank has failed to properly investigate this fraud claim and is holding me liable for a charge I clearly did not authorize or benefit from. The card has not been activated or used physically, and I reported the fraud immediately upon discovery. The cardholder agreement outlines protections against unauthorized charges, and I believe Citi is violating those terms. Additionally, XXXX XXXX enabled this fraud by not requiring identification for either the purchase or the cash return.",Closed with non-monetary relief,6/6/2025

I called to inquire if the plan could be paid early without penalty. I was only advise that I would have to pay the TOTAL amount owed on the plan. I could not apply additional payments solely against the plan. WHAT I WASN'T ADVISED WAS THAT ALL REFUNDS FROM PREVIOUS PURCHASES WOULD BE APPLIED TOWARDS THE INTEREST FREE PLAN AND NOT MY CREDIT CARD PURCHASES. THIS INTEREST FREE PLAN HAS BEEN REDUCED FROM {$12000.00} TO {$5000.00}. IN TWO MONTHS.

I only realized what was happening after a second billing cycle which showed my interest free plan had been reduced by several XXXX of dollars. I call Customer Service. The bank has records of my calls about my issue. The first representative stated my issue would be referred to the escalations department. Last week I spoke to supervisor who assured me it was being looked into. Only, during these conversations, was I advised re : the credit card refund policy to the plan. I was also advised to expect a follow up in writing. 

On XXXX XX/XX/2024, I made another called to the bank and was passed onto a person in the escalations department. He reiterated the plan policy and flatly stated nothing could be done to fix this issue. He gave me the address to write a letter to Chase Card Services. I wanted the funds moved from the plan to the credit card purchases making up my balance. 

I called again later in the afternoon. I asked the representative where -in writing- is the policy advising the consumer that all refunds to my credit card would be applied to the plan first and NOT back against the original purchases.. I also asked where can I see the itemized list of the refund transactions applied to the plan. I only see total amounts reducing the amount owed on plan. My rewards points of over {$1300.00} was cashed in and I do not know if the moneys were applied against the plan. 

When I set up the pay over time payment plan, there was no accompanying documentation. I question if this is a fair practice and even fraudulent. To avoid paying interest on my credit card, I have had to pay a larger interest saving balance. It contradicts the reason why I set it up the plan in the first place.

However, I never received any call from them, which I verified by checking my call log. I am confident that they mistakenly contacted someone at my old address who is not me.

I requested information on which number Capital One called, but they refused to provide any details. Furthermore, they permanently closed my account and card, demanding that I fulfill my financial responsibility without offering any clear explanation or an opportunity to address the issue. 

I believe this situation arose due to a failure in Capital Ones verification process. If they had properly verified the name and birthdate, this issue would not have occurred. This has caused significant inconvenience, especially since I am currently traveling.

Details of the Complaint : Account Holder Name : [ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ] Account Number : [ XXXX ] Incident Date : [ XX/XX/year> ] Credit Union XXXX XXXX Navy Federal Credit Union Summary of the Issue : On [ XXXX XXXX ], my checking account with Navy Federal Credit Union was overdrawn, resulting in a negative balance. I did not authorize any transactions that would have led to this situation. Despite multiple communications with Navy Federal, they have refused to rectify the negative balance or acknowledge their non-compliance with federal regulations. 

Key Points of Concern : Unauthorized Overdraft : I did not opt-in for overdraft services on my account. According to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ) and Regulation E, financial institutions must obtain explicit consent from account holders before processing transactions that would result in an overdraft. Navy Federal failed to comply with this requirement.

Failure to Correct the Negative Balance : Navy Federal has not taken any corrective action to rectify the negative balance on my account despite my repeated requests. This has caused significant inconvenience and financial strain. 
Non-Compliance with Federal Regulations : The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act ( CARD Act ) mandates transparency and fairness in overdraft practices. Navy Federal 's actions violate these protections by subjecting me to an overdraft without explicit consent.

Attempts to Resolve : I have made several attempts to resolve this matter directly with Navy Federal through their eMessaging service. However, they have responded that they consider the matter closed and have refused to provide a satisfactory resolution. They have failed to address my concerns in accordance with federal consumer protection laws. 

Requested Resolution : I am seeking the CFPB 's assistance in ensuring that Navy Federal : Rectifies the negative balance on my account.

Ensures that no fees or penalties are applied to my account as a result of this incident.

Complies with federal consumer protection laws to prevent such issues in the future.

I have attached copies of the communications with Navy Federal for your reference.

Due to my hearing impairment, I am unable to communicate with your representatives by phone and must rely on written correspondence. 

On XX/XX/year>, while I was recovering from hip XXXX at my residence, I noticed that my email spam folder contained several emails from Wells Fargo alerting me to potential suspicious activity. Upon reviewing my email account, I discovered that thousands of dollars had been withdrawn from my account without my authorization. I immediately logged into my Wells Fargo account and noticed the unauthorized transactions. At that time, I took immediate action to lock the card from further use to prevent any further unauthorized transactions. 

Notwithstanding the emails sent to my spam folder alerting me to the potential suspicious activity, Wells Fargo continued to allow daily withdrawals of {$1000.00} via ATMs from XX/XX/year>, to XX/XX/year>. Furthermore, an email in my spam folder indicated that a wrong PIN number was used. It is unclear why Wells Fargo failed to take action to prevent these unauthorized transactions despite the unusual activity and wrong PIN attempt. Specifically, I am unclear why Wells Fargo continued to permit daily withdrawals of {$1000.00} until my balance was reduced to approximately {$300.00}. 

Prior to XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, the only transaction made on my card was at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/year>, for {$64.00}. The subsequent transactions include eight ATM withdrawals of {$1000.00} each on XXXX XXXX XXXX and a charge for {$41.00} on XX/XX/year>, from XXXX XXXX XXXX, which is not authorized.

It started when my friend, XXXX, asked me to help her because her XXXX mother had been scammed and she was on the phone with XXXX Customer Service/Fraud prevention in order to help her mother, XXXX, get refunded. The "" customer service '' person, who ended up being a scammer, said they needed another person in order to verify XXXX XXXX XXXX account ; which they said they would use to refund her mother XXXX The scammer, who I believed to be a legitimate customer service representative for XXXX XXXX had me do a screen share using the app 'XXXX XXXX ', so he could "" help us '' better.

( I would later find out that the XXXX account was fake and did not belong to XXXX ). He told me that the transactions were unsuccessful and that we would have to use XXXX to get XXXX her money back. He had me send the {$4300.00} from my XXXX to the Wells Fargo checking account associated with my XXXX. He then instructed me to send XXXX transactions to accounts/names I did not recognize ; and then, I started to feel that something was wrong. After these transactions XXXX  and I ended the phone call. I asked XXXX more about how she came to be in this situation, and we figured out it was a scam. I immediately changed all passwords and deleted all applications associated with this incident. I then went to my local Wells Fargo branch and was told they could not help me and to call the Wells Fargo customer support to report the fraud. I called immediately and explained the situation as best I could, as I was very shaken up and confused. I let the Wells Fargo employee know that I wanted my accounts closed and new ones open to prevent any further fraudulent transactions from being posted, and I opened claims on all the XXXX transactions. The representative let me know that the initial {$4300.00} that was added to my account was greater than the amount that I had sent out via XXXX, and I actually had more than I started with. This money was not available to me in my account as I had reported it as a part of the claim. 

I did not look at my accounts until I deposited a check at the ATM the next month, as I thought this issue had been resolved and put behind me. I discovered my savings account had been wiped out from a balance of over {$3000.00} to just {$700.00}. I immediately went inside my bank branch for help and was again turned away and told to call. It turns out that even after asking Wells Fargo to close my accounts with the express purpose of preventing additional fraud, that they allowed further fraud to occur to my account. What I was able to figure out by looking at my account is that the initial XXXX transactions of {$1600.00} and {$1500.00} that the scammer had said did not "" go through '' had actually come directly from my personal checking and savings instead of the {$4300.00} that was sent to me. I believe this happened due to the screen share and that the scammer orchestrated this. 

These transactions caused my savings to be over-drafted ; at no time did Wells Fargo contact me to warn me of the further fraud, or put any kind of "" freeze '' on my account or debit card. 

Though this was the first transaction made, it was the last to post ; and therefore, was not a part of my initial claim. I submitted a claim to Wells Fargo about these transactions. The Wells Fargo representative who helped me the second time I called was able to tell me that the initial claims filed had been handled incorrectly by the first representative who helped me. The second representative corrected the initial claims and also started new ones. All claims were ultimately denied even though I explained to them that the transactions should not have been allowed to post several days after I had closed the account to prevent further fraud. They said that the account had not been closed properly and that all pending transactions simply transferred to the new account. In this, Wells Fargo is enabling the scammer in taking my money and is being dishonest with me as their customer. 

I opened a claim for the {$1600.00} and {$1500.00} with XXXX ; as I had figured out that these are the transactions when money was actually stolen from me, wherein the XXXX transactions were by the scammer taking back ( the {$4300.00} ) that had been sent to my XXXX. The XXXX claims were also denied. 

From what I have read of Regulation E of the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, I am legally owed a refund of {$3100.00} that the scammer stole from me by either of both Wells Fargo and XXXX who allowed fraud to happen even after I reported it and alerted them in order to prevent the fraud to take place.",Closed with monetary relief,2/24/2022

The salesperson offered me a credit card to pay for that purchase with no fees or any charges, which I accepted thinking was a good thing.

I am an XXXX, single mother, and this was one of my first credit cards, so I believed what the and the salesperson told me, that would be no fees or other charges. 
I thought I would pay for the amount purchased. They never informed me about the interest charged when paying the minimum. After 2 months I couldnt keep up with the full amount payment because the balance was always increasing, even though I was making regular payments on the due dates. 
The bank started calling me every day, more than 20 times a day, and every time I asked for a payment plan, a settlement, it was denied. 
The last purchase was XX/XX/XXXX and Ive been trying to settle with them since then, but this bank only accepts payment in full of the balance, with no relief of fees or interest. 
My actual debt is only {$430.00}, and I offered them to pay {$100.00} in XXXX installments, but the answer was always no.

I charged gas, groceries, etc. onto the card and the credit card was paid, IN FULL, every month, by the due date, for 18 years. 

I worked up to a {$20000.00} credit line, which has a strong bearing on my credit score.

One day, my credit card stops working.

I had received no warning, no email, no text, no phone, no letter.

When I call PNC for an explanation, I am told that PNC "" severed the relationship ''.

No reason, no warning. I was told I would receive a letter in the mail explaining why the relationship was severed.

I have no personal accounts at PNC Bank.

I finally received the letter and it said "" unacceptable behavior on another PNC account ''.

I don't have another PNC account with PNC Bank? So this makes no sense.

My only conclusion is that they are referring to my grandfather, who helped me open the account but as far as I am aware, he is not the primary card holder, I am, and he doesn't put charges on the credit card nor pay the credit card, so it doesn't really make any sense.

I have asked for a more clear explanation and have never been given one. 

When I received my final statement, there was no check for my {$71.00} or more in cash rewards. When I called PNC Bank to ask if I would be receiving a check with my rewards, they said my rewards were forfeited when the card was closed.

GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA,Credit card,7/22/2024,CA,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX GOLDMAN SACHS Dear Sir/Madam , I am writing to bring to your attention a matter regarding a recent credit application I submitted to Goldman Sachs. Pursuant to the provisions outlined in 15 U.S. Code 1691, it has come to my attention that my application was denied despite my having exercised my rights under this chapter in good faith. 

Specifically, the law prohibits creditors from discriminating against any applicant in any aspect of a credit transaction based on the applicant 's exercise of rights under the law. Despite my genuine and lawful application, I received an adverse action, which is defined under the law as a refusal to grant credit in substantially the amount or on substantially the terms requested.

I believe that Goldman Sachs may have inadvertently overlooked my rights under the law, and I am writing to give you the opportunity to rectify this situation before further escalation is considered necessary. I trust that Goldman Sachs values compliance with federal regulations and aims to remedy any inadvertent oversights promptly. 

I am hopeful that by bringing this matter to your attention, we can resolve it amicably and ensure that my application is reconsidered in accordance with the law. Please feel free to contact me at the email address to discuss this matter further or to provide any clarification you may require.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

Mr. Cooper Group Inc.,Mortgage,4/18/2024,WA,"In XX/XX/XXXX I opened a bridge loan ( Account # XXXX address XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, WA XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX to purchase a new home while I awaited for my home to sell. XXXX XXXX utilizes the services of Rushmore Loan Servicing to handle all collection of payments and servicing of loans. 
The bridge loan was opened on XX/XX/XXXX and paid off in full on XX/XX/XXXX. 
As part of the loan process, I paid {$4200.00} into the escrow account which was to cover the XXXX property taxes on the house I was living in, in the event it did not sell before property taxes were due. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I received two checks from Rushmore in the amounts of {$38000.00} and {$2300.00}. I deposited both checks with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX days later, I was notified by XXXX XXXX that Rushmore Servicing had placed a stop payment on the check for XXXX XXXXXXXX, with no explanation. 
I contacted Rushmore Servicing customer service at least 6 times via telephone, sent emails through their on-line loan software program and additional emails through my XXXX email account, inquiring as to the reason for the check cancelation. No customer service rep could ever explain why the check was canceled and when/if I would receive a replacement check. I received several auto replies from Rushmore stating the inquiry had been closed, with never any explanation as to why the check was issued or cancelled. 
In addition to asking why the XXXX XXXXXXXX check had been canceled, I inquired as to when I would receive the balance of my escrow funds. I never received a response regarding the escrow question either. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I asked my mortgage broker, XXXX XXXX for assistance. XXXX contacted her contact person at XXXX XXXX for assistance. Neither were ever successful in getting an answer to either of my questions. 
At the end of XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a complaint with the WA State Attorney General 's Office. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a phone call from a customer service representative with Rushmore who assured me she was going to help me get a detailed accounting of my bridge loan payoff amount and she would look into the situation with the balance of my escrow account which I was owed. She asked me to give her some time, which I agreed to. A week went by and I had not heard from her. On XX/XX/XXXX I received another phone call from the same woman and she apologized for taking so long with a response and asked for more time to research my issues. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Rushmore customer service rep XXXX XXXX who said he was working on a response to my complaint I filed with the state. He asked for some clarification regarding pre-paying "" interest. '' I told him I had not prepaid interest, but I had prepaid my property taxes which were in escrow. 
After several days, I did not hear back from XXXX, so sent him a follow-up email asking when I would receive the full loan payoff accounting and when I would receive the balance of my escrow funds. I received a response from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX stating he needed additional time to complete his review. 
It is now XX/XX/XXXX and I have not received the detailed accounting of my bridge loan that lasted a total of 23 days. It really should not be this hard or take this long to produce the requested information. In addition, Rushmore still owes me the balance of my escrow funds, totaling {$2100.00}. The check I received in the amount of {$2300.00}, was for {$2100.00} in escrow and the balance was a fee they were refunding me.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a purchase of a XXXX XXXX XXXX totaling {$920.00}, inclusive of taxes and fees. During the checkout process, I specifically selected the "" Signature Confirmation '' option with the courier to ensure secure delivery, as indicated on my order confirmation. 

However, on XX/XX/XXXX, the scheduled delivery date, my package failed to arrive, and to my dismay, no signature was obtained as per the selected delivery option. Despite my persistent efforts to resolve this matter with both XXXX XXXX and XXXX, a satisfactory resolution has remained elusive. 

Of utmost concern is the fact that XXXX, despite being repeatedly contacted, has been unable to provide any proof of a signature for the delivery, despite its critical importance in this situation. Despite their standard practice of providing photographic evidence of delivered packages and obtaining signatures as proof of delivery, the documentation for this specific delivery only states that the package was "" Left at Front Door, '' devoid of any photographic or signature evidence. 

Furthermore, I have made numerous attempts to address this issue with Syncrony Bank, the provider of the store card for my XXXX purchases. Regrettably, my claims for reimbursement have been summarily denied on three separate occasions ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ), with each response failing to acknowledge the necessity of concrete proof of delivery, particularly a signature. 

I am reaching out to request your urgent assistance in resolving this matter. Given the circumstances outlined above, it is imperative that we obtain conclusive evidence of delivery and take appropriate measures to rectify this situation promptly. 

Please advise on the best course of action to address this issue effectively. Your prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.

My attempts to resolve this issue through Synchrony Bank have been met with repeated closures of my disputes. They consistently side with the merchant 's false claims of attempting to contact me for a refund, despite no such efforts being made.

This situation has dragged on for over four months, and I am increasingly disillusioned with Synchrony 's lack of support and protection for consumers like myself.

Per their terms and conditions, after meeting these requirements my {$900.00} bonus was to be paid into my account within 15 days. 

I opened my accounts with Chase in late XXXX of XXXX. My bonus payment should have been made by mid XX/XX/XXXX.

The people who had quit informed me on XX/XX/2024, that the merchant was attempting to claim that the job was fully done, even though the job was not fully completed. I immediately contacted the merchant on XX/XX/2024. Due to The lack of substantive response from the firm, I initiated a dispute with my credit card company JP Morgan Chase. 

JP Morgan Chase did an initial investigation. During the dispute process, the merchant made many false claims, one of them being that the job they were hired to do was completed. That is entirely not true. The job is not completed. 

Initially JP Morgan Chase, believing the false statements of the merchant, sided with the merchant on XX/XX/2024. I submitted a re-dispute on XX/XX/2024 where I outlined in great detail how exactly the work was not completed and that there were several instances of quality issues with the work. Namely, the main quality issue is that the merchant stopped working on the job I hired them to do entirely after the key personnel left on XX/XX/2024. 

I had reached out to one of the key employees who had quit the merchants organization and they wrote a 6-page long affidavit outlining that the work was not completed. 

I resubmitted my dispute on XX/XX/2024 with many pages of documentation and the affidavit of the former employee. 

JP Morgan Chase wrongly did not open my re-dispute and is not assisting me with this dispute any further. I would ask that JP Morgan Chase please review the facts of my dispute and please re-open the dispute as a quality of service issue because although some work was completed, it was not entirely completed, and to stop working in the middle of a job has forced me to spend an additional {$6000.00} for another merchant to complete the work that the original merchant is refusing to complete.

I am writing to formally bring to your attention a concerning matter regarding my interactions with Capital One Bank, as detailed below. 

On Thursday, XX/XX/year>, at approximately XXXX XXXX Eastern Time, I spoke with Supervisor XXXX, who informed me that an investigation concerning my account had concluded on XX/XX/year>. Regrettably, I was not informed of this conclusion. To my surprise, on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, Supervisors XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX had all indicated to me that the investigation was still ongoing. Supervisor XXXX further conveyed that Capital One often fails to adhere to its own outlined processes, as documented in their email communications. 

Throughout this ordeal, I have engaged with over 50 customer service representatives and 10 supervisors, none of whom informed me that the investigation had been completed. This lack of transparency and inconsistent information has left me deeply concerned and frustrated. 

Given my current health emergency, I urgently request Capital One to either grant me access to my account or transfer the funds to a linked account, as explicitly stipulated in their correspondence. Their emails have assured me that deposits could continue to be made, yet I have been denied access without justification. 

Additionally, I must highlight that due to both health concerns and the evident disregard for transparency by Capital One, I am hesitant to visit a branch in person. The repeated misinformation and apparent mistreatment have not only jeopardized my financial stability but have also compromised my dignity. 

I kindly request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate this matter thoroughly and intervene on my behalf. I believe that Capital One 's actions have been unjust and have caused me undue stress and financial hardship during an already challenging time. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your assistance in resolving this issue swiftly.

I got no alert for the whole process - normally even if I request a credit card replacement, I got alert. However, this time, no alert for the fraudulent debit card replacement and pin reset. 

On XX/XX/2024, criminals went to a Chase XXXX in XXXX and withdrew {$6000.00} from my XXXX  account and {$25000.00} from my XXXX  account, XXXX transactions separated by about XXXX minutes, at the help of a Chase teller.

Chase declined my request and said the bank doesn't do investigation. I believe it is a violation of the CFPB rule.

SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,Credit card,6/19/2024,NJ,"Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to file a complaint regarding the practices of Synchrony Bank with my PayPal credit card. I made a payment on my account on XX/XX/XXXX, and while the payment has been credited to my account, the funds are not available for use until XX/XX/XXXX. This delay, almost a full billing cycle, is unprecedented and unreasonable. 

Synchrony Banks justification for this delay is that it is a normal practice in case I cancel my posted payment, which is not possible. I have never experienced such a problem with any other credit card. This delay has caused significant inconvenience ; for instance, I am unable to pay certain bills because my transactions keep getting declined, even though my balance is {$3.00}. The payment covered the full balance, and the card has a limit that is less than any other card I have, making this extended hold period even more baffling and unjustifiable. 

Additionally, I have encountered issues with using the PayPal credit card at reputable car rental companies like XXXX and XXXX. They informed me that they can not accept this form of payment due to prior issues and the volume of problems they have had with this card. They would not provide any further details. This suggests there may be other questionable practices by Synchrony Bank that are affecting the acceptance of this card. 

When I contacted Synchrony Banks customer support, I was informed, with an unhelpful attitude, that this is standard practice. It is unacceptable and unheard of for a credit card company to withhold credit usage for such an extended period after a payment has been posted. This policy should be clearly communicated to all customers. 

I urge the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate these practices, understand why these policies exist, and determine what consumer laws can be applied to protect customers like myself from such unfair treatment. Specifically, if a card is paid and the balance is fulfilled, why is the credit not released promptly? 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

CHASE bank sent me information on my home loan with two separate loan numbers. I requested payment history for the life of the loan and this is a legal requirement for home lenders to provide.

They also failed to provide a full payment history on how additional payments were applied.

They also claim that a qualified written request or notice of error should be sent to Chase Bank at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Ohio XXXX. Because documents were faxed to the CEO, it is her responsibility is to get these documents to the proper department. Obviously this was not done. 

There are two loan numbers pertaining to my loan and multiple errors made in the application of payments that were not corrected despite me faxing notice of error to CHASE bank. Example, my loan maturation date is XX/XX/2022, my payments are XXXX a month instead of getting credit for additional payments to this loan, the payments were added to my principal and now my loan balance is XXXX vs XXXX.Origination date stayed the same CHASE bank CEO then sent an apology letter stating the bank had made an error in calculating my principal balance but no accounting was provided.

CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,Checking or savings account,4/5/2024,MD,"I hope this message finds you well. My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX and for over a decade, I have been a proud and dedicated customer of Capital One Bank XXXX As a XXXX veteran and the proprietor of a minority-owned small business, a dependable and supportive banking relationship is fundamental to my operations and overall success. 

I am writing to urgently request your intervention in a matter that has significantly impacted my business and personal financial stability. Initially, on Tuesday, XX/XX/year>, I sought assistance from both Capital One leadership and the Maryland Attorney Generals Office regarding a severe issue with my business account. Despite assurances of a prompt resolution, the situation has alarmingly deteriorated. 

By Wednesday, XX/XX/year>, I discovered my account was overdrawn by more than {$17000.00} due to a disputed check endorsement, prompting an unjustified hold on my funds by Capital One. This has gravely affected my operational capacity, causing missed client deadlines, late payments, and reputational damage due to bounced checks. 

Efforts to rectify this, including communications with XXXX from the Presidents Office and the small business team, have regrettably been in vain. As of today, Friday, XX/XX/year>, the predicament has escalated with the imposition of multiple NSF fees for returned payments and the restriction of my personal accounts alongside my business ones. 

The Consumer Protection department was incredibly unhelpful and wrongly stated that the certified check that I deposited was returned, when in fact, Capital One Bank bookkeeping put a chargeback hold due to the endorsement of the check, not the availability of funds.

This morning, to my astonishment and despair, I was informed that all my accounts are being erroneously closed and frozen, denying me access to the capital I have earnestly accumulated. This error not only exacerbates my current predicament but also places an unbearable strain on my ability to meet financial obligations and sustain my business.

The cumulative effect of these actions by Capital One Bank is not only disappointing but alarming, casting doubts on the reliability and integrity of its operations. As a loyal customer who has relied on your services for essential banking needs, I am deeply disheartened by this experience.

I respectfully urge a comprehensive investigation into these matters and immediate corrective measures to unfreeze and restore my accounts. Additionally, I seek compensation for the undue financial hardship and distress this situation has inflicted.

Your prompt and decisive resolution of this issue is critical for the survival of my business and the preservation of my financial well-being. I am prepared to provide any further information or documentation needed to expedite this process.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this critical matter. I eagerly await your response and am hopeful for a swift and favorable resolution. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Forwarded message XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX From : XXXX XXXX XXXX Date : Tue, XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX Subject : Urgent Request for Investigation : Possible Civil Rights Violation Regarding Account Holds To : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX Dear Capital One Bank Leadership and Attorney General, I hope this message finds you well. My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX and I am writing to you as a loyal customer of Capital One Bank for over ten years. As a XXXX veteran and a minority-owned small business owner, a convenient and reliable banking relationship is imperative to sustainability. 

I am compelled to bring to your attention a concerning matter that has recently occurred, which I believe warrants immediate investigation. On two separate occasions within the past year, including most recently on XX/XX/year>, significant funds in the amount of {$43000.00} were held in my business account for an unreasonable length of time. 

The deposit made on XX/XX/year>, was a cashier 's check from a black-owned bank. It is noteworthy to mention that in my 20 years of banking, I have never had a cashier 's check held for seven days. 

What is particularly distressing is not only the prolonged hold on these funds but also the complete inability to access any funds in the account, including those I had transferred from my personal account. Despite my inquiries into the reason for the hold and my urgent need for access to the funds, I was met with unprofessional treatment and disrespect. Regrettably, I was hung up on twice during my attempts to resolve this issue.

As a person of color, I can not ignore the possibility that these actions may constitute a civil rights violation, especially considering similar experiences I have heard from other customers of color. It is deeply troubling to think that such discriminatory practices may be occurring within our banking system.

Therefore, I implore the leadership at Capital One Bank to launch a thorough investigation into this matter. It is imperative that we ascertain the reasons behind these holds, ensure that they are not rooted in discriminatory practices, and take appropriate action to rectify any injustices that may have occurred.

Additionally, I am reaching out to the Maryland Attorney Generals Office to request their involvement in investigating this issue. It is crucial that we work together to uphold the principles of fairness, equality, and justice within our banking institutions.

I sincerely hope that you will take this matter seriously and initiate prompt action to address it. I am available to provide any further information or assistance that may be required for the investigation.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

The email listed under my "" Loan Specialist '' does not go to her ... as US Bank states, that email is for document submission only... how do I email my loan specialist, as no one ever answers the number listed for her or returns voicemails.

I believe this loan has been reported inaccurately for over 4 years because of the calculations above not being applied to the account correctly. 

This in turn, along with the lack/inability to contact anyone concerning this, has destroyed my credit and made it impossible to modify or refinance this loan.

"CITIBANK, N.A.",Credit card,4/27/2024,NJ,"On XX/XX/2024, I called Home Depot and the Recording sated my Balance was {$130.00}. I checked this because I spoke with a representative about the XXXX, XXXX  Account Statement I received and I questioned the New Balance of {$170.00}. 
I was told there was a late fee of {$40.00} & the Representative said this late fee could be waived. Once this was done the Total Amount Due was {$130.00}. This is way I called back on XX/XX/2024 to confirm my balance. 

I tried paying this balance at the XXXX XXXX Home Depot Store, however, the representative wasnt educated on how to accept payments and after 3 tries of being denied, was when I found out that you need to use a card with a pin number. Therefore, I did not want to experience this again so I mailed a check to the Home Depot Credit Services in XXXX, PA. They received it on XX/XX/2024 when it was sent on XX/XX/2024. 

The representative I was on the phone with confirmed the payment of {$130.00} was received. Since this was the balance owed and paid in full, I cancelled my card and account with Home Depot. 

Then in XXXX, 2024 I received an Account Statement with a New Balance of {$180.00}???? I did not make any purchases from Home Depot during the month of XXXX. 2024 because I had closed out my account and shredded my card. 
I called and tried to speak with a representative, but it was over 2 weeks before I was able to speak with a representative. The representative was not able to explain this. He took the payment of {$130.00} from the {$180.00} and said the difference was {$43.00}???? What was this for because at the end of XXXX, 2024 my balance was {$130.00} and it was PAID in FULL?? 

Then I received another Account Statement for XXXX, 2024 and the New Balance on this Account Statement was {$85.00}???? I tried calling and never spoke to anyone until this week. By this time, I only wanted the address of the Corporate Office of Home Depot so I could write a letter to dispute these charges. In XXXX, I asked 3 representatives for the address of the Corporate Office so I could contact them, however, each one of them had no idea of the address of the Corporate Office of the company they worked for??? 
I am asking to please cancel the XXXX & XXXX, 2024 Account Statements sent to me after I closed my account with Home Depot as of XXXX, 2024. 

When I felt I was not making any progress, I went to the Post Office to send a Letter to Home Depot Credit Services to the address I was finally given by a representative. However, when I went to mail the letter and requested it be sent via Certified Mail, the Post Office representative put the zip code in the system and nothing came up. Therefore I could not mail the letter. Then I prepared a Letter to Citibank because when I got home from the Post Office I had received a Letter from Citibank and the address on the letter had a difference po box number & zip code. I did not hear back from the letters I sent, so I decided to contacted my Attorney and explained the situation to him. He prepared a Letter to Home Depot Credit Services on XX/XX/2024. 

Then on XX/XX/2024 I received a letter from Home Depot and from Citibank. They wanted me to call them but since my Attorney sent them a letter, I reached out to him to let him know of the letters I received and should I call them or have him call them. He suggested I call them back. Both Letters suggested I call the Collections Dept. So I called the number on the letter. The representative I spoke with wanted to know my progress on my filing for Bankruptcy. WHAT??? He said there was a note that I was applying for Bankruptcy. THIS IS A LIE!!! I am not applying for any Bankruptcy. I worked for 8 years and paid off my debt due to metal expenses. Everything was all paid off and now my credit score is XXXX! However, I received notification that my credit score had dropped XXXX points because of this situation with Home Depot Credit Services.

U.S. BANCORP,Mortgage,4/28/2022,MD,"Hello, I am writing to formally request a complaint against US Bank and their FHA-loan modification practices. I have been trying to submit a FHA-loan modification to prevent foreclosure of my home since approximately XXXX of XXXX as my financial hardship has been resolved from my divorce. It is 6 months later and I am still trying to get the loan modification. I constantly have been paying on the mortgage and they only apply it to a suspense account and not the mortgage. I have constantly been making payments. My ex-husband and I are on the original loan documents for the house we purchased when we married. In XXXX he attempted to murder me and is currently an imprisoner for it sentenced to 30 years to life. This is all online is you search my name. I have a divorce decree awarding me the sole ownership of the house. My ex-husband also signed a recorded quit-claim deed however US BANK keeps insisting that i can not do the loan modification by myself although it states if I have these documents listed above I can do so and not need his signature to proceed with the loan modification although he will still be held liable. It states on pages 4 of 9 on the loan modification documents that the modification can be completed without him signing as long as I have the supporting documentation in which I have : a recorded quit claim deed and a divorce decree evidencing my ownership of the house. I have sent US BANK all the required documentation and payments necessary to start the loan modification process several times however the loss mitigation department refuses to send the documentation without his name listed and without requiring him to sign. I am in the process of procuring a lawsuit to have this matter resolved and will be asking for damages not only financially but emotionally as I am not supposed to have contact with my ex-husband or any dealings pertaining to him due to a court order which I also explained to the representatives at US BANK, due to the circumstances of the court. I am requesting to do the loan modification in my name solely as I am the sole legal owner of the house, I am able to afford the payments and I have all the required legal documentation to move forward in doing such. I have called several times and received misinformation and false hope repeatedly. All calls are recorded and I have several loss mitigation representatives names documented, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ' and the list goes on. I need assistance in handling this matter as I am trying to reside in my primary residence and have no intention on losing or selling the home that myself and my children reside in. I have already contacted a law firm to handle this matter if a resolution can not be met and they are already authorized as a third party on my account as proof that I am in the process of litigation. I ask that this matter be escalated to the correct department. I would like for the loan modification documents to be processed without requiring my ex-husbands signature but processed with just my physical wet signature. I am requesting to retain my home and for US BANK to allow me to assume the mortgage after successful payments have been made to formally remove his name from the mortgage as he is already relinquished his rights to any ownership of the house. I have phone records, documented names and times as well as documentation US BANK has sent saying they made errors in my paperwork and asking me to resend documentation. They offered me different programs to include the HAMP-FHA modification that stated I only needed to make a payment to accept the terms and signatures weren't required. I did that as well sending two payments in the month of XX/XX/XXXX because I was offered two different loan programs and told to make a payment for each. My ex husband once agreed to the loan modification and signed the documents. I submitted the paperwork to US BANK however they rejected it on error, the documents went stale after 90 days and now he no longer wants to cooperate in the loan modification process due to it. I was told underwriting would process the documents without his name due to me having the required documentation for the task to be completed however they keep sending the documents in both our names requiring both signatures and telling me they can not process the documentation without him.",Closed with non-monetary relief,4/28/2022

I did not realize this until 2 months later when I received my statement in the mail advising I owed them late payment fees. ( I originally had the statements electronically sent. ) I called Care Credit ; I spoke with a nice lady, and she explained to me that somehow my automatic payments did not set up, she would set me up for automatic payments, ( this is supposed to have all been on a recording ), and that I needed to pay {$77.00} to bring my account up to date, which I did.
